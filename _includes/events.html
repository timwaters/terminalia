          <h3>10am, Stroud. Radical Stroud: Terminalia Festival Walk </h3>
  
  
          <p class="text">
            The folks at <a href="http://www.radicalstroud.co.uk">Radical Stroud</a> have a walk planned for Stroud involving three very different interactions with boundaries and
            landmarks: spatial, temporal and linguistic.
            <br /> <br />
            <b>1.</b> Meet at the <a href="http://upperlockcafe.co.uk/">Upper Lockkeeper’s Café</a> at 10am when
            <b>Jon Seagrave</b> will explain how the shadowy operatives of Stroud & District Psychogeography and Deep Topography Commission
            are attempting a 'subjective remapping' of the town, asking for YOUR assistance in locating the unseen energies that
            shape and guide our everyday actions here in the bosom of the Five Valleys. Where did YOU have your first kiss? Where
            do YOU go when you want tranquillity, or fancy a fist-fight? Help identify Aggression Hotpots, Enlightenment Nodes and
            Knee-Trembler Clusters! Ritual Pilgrimages and Fertility Dances may result!
            <br /> <br />
  
            <b>2.</b>
            <b>Robin Treefellow</b> will take us on a guided walk to Woodchester Roman Villa where we will slip through all manner of
            wormholes of Time.
            <br /> <br />
            <b>3.</b> We will then walk up Water Lane to the long barrow at Selsley where
            <b>Stuart Butler</b> will take us on a brief history of swearing: the boundaries between the sacred and the profane; the
            elemental and excremental; the physical and the psychical; by Janus and ...
            <br /> Robin Treefellow will also talk of the two names of this barrow: The Toots and the Blacklow – it was the site of the
            old Saxon hundred moot called Blacklow Hundred. Folk still like to gather there!
            <br /> We will finish with a toast to Faunus.
          </p>
          <p class="text-faded">
  
            Please bring food and drink to share....And so to home. <br />

          <h3>11am, Seasalter, nr Whistable.  Walking with The Waste Land </h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            On Friday the 23rd of February,
            members from the walking group
            Walking with The Waste Land and their
            friends will be conducting a walk from
            the Sportsman Car Park in Seasalter,
            near Whitstable, in Kent. We will meet at
            11a.m. in order to catch the low tide at
            11.47.
          </p>
          <p>
            On this walk we will walk to "Mick’s
            post" from here we will experiment with
            some low tide mud walking, using knots
            in ropes to record the experience. <br />
            We will then return to Mick’s post where
            where we will tie the knotted ropes to
            Mick’s post in a symbolic ritual of the celebration of Terminus.

          </p>
          <p class="text-faded">
            Mick’s post is a white post in Seasalter which has been erected near the sea wall to indicate the
            boundary for the digging of bait in the estuary. <br />

          <p class="text">
            In honour of Terminalia, Ruth and you will be walking around the walls of Colchester town in Essex - the oldest and longest town wall still surviving in Britain today, 'beating the bounds' and taking in the breathtaking views of the town and its environs. Colchester prides itself on being the oldest recorded town in Britain. The Roman wall is home to some of the <a href="http://www.romanwall.org/?page_id=347">rarest mosses and lichens</a> and if you look really hard you may even find one of the remaining ammonite fossils in the wall. Odd finds such as the slice of wall sitting beside pizza place all add to the curiosity of this ancient structure.
          </p>
          <p class="text-faded">
            We will depart from the Firstsite Gallery Cafe at noon on Friday 23rd Feb - find address and map here: <a href="http://firstsite.uk/visit/">http://firstsite.uk/visit/</a>

            <h3> 5.30pm, Leeds. Beating the Bounds Walk - Circular walk around our boundary of Leeds</h3>
          
              <p class="text">5.30pm Route planning, dowsing and map browsing for a strict 6pm departure from the bar at  <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/204237011">Wharf Chambers Co-op Club</a> . 2 hrs (easy). Bring treats to share, flowers to leave and alcoholic or soft drinks to keep you warm! With events, interventions, and special performances from local artists. Led  by Tim Waters
              </p>

              <p class="text">
                  A slightly different format to past years, we will find, in addition to the medieval stones, our own boundary markers of the city. Using crystal dowsing techniques over maps in the bar beforehand participants will plot out a route to follow within the city centre. Walkers will then head out to explore the divined places and examine whats there and uncover boundary indicators. Once done (or after a set amount of time), examining our new boundary markers and the map, we will head inwards to find the centre. At each newly found marker, we shall celebrate the boundary with snacks, drinks and flowers, do please bring some to share! 
                </p>
          
              <p class="text-faded">
                We're happy to report that 2018 finds all the medieval boundary markers of Leeds, the bars, marked with blue plaques and/or uncovered. Our actions over the years has been successful! This year we will seek in addition to explore the city by finding new boundary places. The medieval boundary stones marked out the limits of the medieval city, and the entrances and toll booths for animals and trade. Terminus is also the god of non physical boundaries such as time and seasons and relationships. How has the city changed from ancient times - can we ask our unconcious minds where these new marks would or should be?

          Tapping Into The City looks at our movements through private-public space in the city, the impact of urban surroundings on us and our relations with each other.
          <br />
              Come and join in this live art piece - a group walk around Stratford - one of London's most overtly regenerated areas and centres of privatised-public space (Westfield Stratford City, Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and East Village are all within walking distance).
          </p>
          <p class="text">
          Friday 23rd February, 6.30pm. Meeting point - at the bottom of the Meridian Steps (the stairs leading up to Westfield, next to the bus and underground station and opposite Stratford Centre).
          <br />
          Nathania will explain the piece and then we'll walk together for an hour or so, simply moving as one through the city space, listening to its sound and the sound of our feet. Afterwards we can retreat to a warm pub nearby. Ideally we'll wear shoes with pennies stuck to the soles.

        <h3>6.30. Dalston, London: #DiviningDalston - Wonder Wander around Ridley Road and Dalston</h3>
      
      
        <p class="text">
          It's Terminalia Festival of Psychogeography, so after years of informally exploring and documenting Dalston, Hackney Tours
          is pairing up with cult Ridley Road gallery space Doomed to host another Hackney Tours Wonder Wander in this fascinating
          and culturally rich area.
          <br /> 
          Hackney Tours has been combing the borough since 2009 and recording the results (see here for examples) while Doomed
          have been running deliberately non-commericial shows with a strong photography element and hosting alternative free education
          sessions by arts academics.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
        Join some interesting fellow travellers to stimulate your grey matter. Tour guides, photographers, philosophers, thinkers...
        <br /> 
        Dust off your Debord and let's take our very own Dérive (Drift) – making our own fun as we explore the backstreets and
        create our own psychogeographical work.
        <br /> 
        Don't be intimidated by any of the big French words, it's really just about being open and receptive to what's around
        you and taking a moment to stop and smell the flowers. That's what I call a 'wonder wander'. Your opinion and thoughts
        about what you see and experience are what's important, not what a textbook says.
        <br /> 
        We might make some amateur maps, take some photos, or create a narrative. It's not rocket science - but it is fun!
        <br /> 
        WE WILL, OF COURSE, FINISH IN A PUB OR ENVIRONMENT CONDUSIVE TO HYDRATED DEBATE....
