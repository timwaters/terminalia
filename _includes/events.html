          <h3> Bernardo Bruno: EVERYWHERE BORDERS</h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
        Bernardo Bruno created an participatory interactive experience for 2021, focusing on a series of virtual meetings, film screenings and discussions. <br /><br />
        The theme EVERYWHERE: BORDERS has a double meaning, symbolic and expressive. A reflection on physical boundaries and "confinement" From this year the Festival is open to all those who want to perform a ritual action inspired by the TERMINALIA, the pagan festival in honor of the God Terminus everywhere. Those who want to simultaneously on February 23 between 15 and 18 will be able to create their own Terminalia. By documenting the action performed with photos or a short video (max 3 minutes), you will be able to share this experience during a final FORUM MEETING which will take place on 27 February from 6to 8 pm.

          Aled Singleton walked and produced a video: <br />
          This Terminalia walk is called "A4072", named after a road that goes north from Newport. Aled and his mother follow the road line from a demolished
          a cappella into a deceased pub, stopping at places where people have previously been to grab a drink and to find themselves closer to God.

          "Today I walk an imaginary line around my house. My feet don’t leave indentations to show I have done it, not since the recent snow, and when that melted, the trace was gone. Home and back, I pace and pound my boundary line, a pathway that returns to itself, reconnects, reattaches, brings me back to the garden gate." <br />

        <h3>Tamsin Grainger: Walking Between Worlds</h3>
      
      
        <p class="text">
          <a href="https://walkingwithoutadonkey.com/2020/02/17/walking-between-worlds/">This walk</a> was part of the <a href="https://audaciouswomen.scot/">Audacious Women Festival 2021</a> and Terminalia Festival. This walk was originally made on foot with a live group in Edinburgh 3pm – sunset (5.30pm). It was an online tour for anyone who was ambulant or not, in Edinburgh or not! We toured part of the Leith boundary, the Rosebank Cemetery, the North Leith Burial Ground, and the streets in between, using a special format with information, photos, video, maps and conversation about the wonderful women associated with Leith’s past and contemporary connections. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-faded">
          The original tour was a circular one of approx. 2.5 hrs, to muse and meditate on boundaries and borders – between one community of people and another, day and night, life and death and on the cusp of the new moon. <br />
          We visited the graves of notable women in Rosebank Cemetery, North Leith Burial Ground and South Leith Parish Church. Briefly, at each stopping place, we faced the memorial stones, and learned about their incumbents. <br />

We shall remember John Thelwall (radical visitor here in the summer of 1798), Colonel Despard (executed February 21st 1803) and Catherine Despard, African-American political activist."
        </p>
        <p class="text-faded">
          Places to visit and remember: 1. Nailsworth retirement village. 2. Chalford Bottom. 3. Bowbridge. (all by bicycle to remember how John Thelwall challenged boundaries) 4. Nelson Street: (a.) where the future General Wolfe (killed at Quebec 1759) had troops stationed ready against local weavers. (b.) Nelson Street and Trafalgar House – what names tell us and hide – the boundaries of nomenclature and ‘the naming of parts’ - (hidden history: Nelson and Despard; Nelson and the saving of his life by ‘a woman of colour’, Cubah Cornwallis; Nelson and his support for the ‘West India Interest’ and plantocracy); Black Boy Clock; the Duke of York. <br />

        <h3> Andrew Budd: Terminalia 2021 - on the brink</h3>
      
      
        <p class="text">
          <a href="https://sootallures.wixsite.com/topographersarms/post/terminalia-2021-on-the-brink"> Andrew Budd did a solo walk. </a>
          <br />

          "I’m almost out of bounds. I’m standing on the edge. I’m at the lowest point. But I’m feeling good....
          <br />
          I’m on my own today. It’s the pandemic, and I’m only allowed to walk with someone if it’s ‘exercise’. At this waterside I’m nearly half way round a five mile loop that I’d planned, and I’m fighting a blasting from the wind. It’s definitely exercise and not just a leisurely stroll. Today, I’m in a solitary mood, feeling that I need to be alone. I’m reflecting on life at present and wondering when we might get back to ‘normal’, when a group of friends can walk out together, and not have to worry about keeping our distance from each other. A time we can beat the bounds, collectively. Sounds like Terminalia 2022 will be a bigger celebration. But today, I’ve enjoyed the loneliness of the ‘enthusiast’ in a remote spot, in nature, in pursuit of his romantic ideas about history and geography, and his insignificance in the big scheme of everything else...


          <br />
          I have no garland or wine to offer to the God Terminus at this outpost boundary. But I thank him for keeping watch over me, on the brink."

        <h3> Charlotte Rooney / Topoanimus : Terminalia Walk</h3>
      
      
        <p class="text">
          <a href="https://topoanimus.co.uk/2021/02/23/terminalia-2021/">Charlotte writes</a> that she usually joins the local walking tribes, Radical Stroud and Walking The Land in celebration for Terminalia. "This year, the Covid year, we have all walked today in solitude or in pairs." <br /> <br />
          "This year I had a yearning to explore boundaries of self and the landscape, to see if I could ‘let it in’. We have such a concept of ourselves as sovereign, largely impenetrable firmly contained within our bag of skin where ‘out there’ and ‘in here’ is so obvious as to be unconscious to most. And yet, we are constantly, intimately connected to each other and the outside in a fundamental and deeply intimate way. There is a constant flow and exchange through and with us and the world – through the air we inhale and the carbon dioxide we exhale, the food we eat and digest. All the things we sense that directly influence and affect our nervous systems, animating us, causing synapses to fire, chemical reactions to cascade, pupils to dilate, mouths to salivate – the list is endless.  The idea that we are somehow separate is a nonsense.
          <br />
          I also wanted to return to the longbarrows, and sit on that edge of on/under the earth and the present and the past.  I walked with Jon and dog Millie, who kept dog Fen in order – and as is not uncommon, the walk had a mind of it’s own and threw up unexpected considerations and synchronicities." <br />
          <img src="img/past/2021/20210223_215529.jpg" />
        </p>
        <p>
          "We started on Coaley Peak, and the walk from Nymphsfield Longbarrow to Hetty Peglars Tump was in itself a small study in boundaries, criss-crossing the road, and jumping walls into fields and following desire paths along hedgerow to avoid it. We spent time lying in the body-shaped hollows atop the tump, sheltered somewhat from the wind.".... 
        </p>
        <p>
          Once at home, it is time to carry out my personal Terminalia ritual. Three years ago on my first Terminalia walk, I consecrated my own Terminus stone. As close as I could get to the original Roman ritual, I libated it with local honey, wine, ashes from our hearth and in lieu of a sacrificial ram, I buried the jawbone of a lamb which I’d found on that day’s walk underneath it.  Since then, I have reconsecrated it each year on the 23 February. I also take water from our spring and bless the boundaries of our land (ie garden), with a prayer to Terminus based on permeable boundaries:
          <br />  <br />
          <blockquote>that all good be allowed to pass in, and all bad be kept out</blockquote>
          <br />
