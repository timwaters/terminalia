          <h3>10am Stroud, UK, Radical Stroud: A Circumnavigation of Stroud and investigation of the "Five Valleys" </h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            For the 2022 Terminalia walk we will follow the established route of the Way Around Stroud Way (WAS Way).  Please follow <a href="https://www.stroudtown.gov.uk/uploads/was-way-map-web.pdf">https://www.stroudtown.gov.uk/uploads/was-way-map-web.pdf</a> to obtain the excellent and very informative guide to the walk.  This contains a map, trail guide, height profile and concise details of the fascinating history of Stroud and the five valleys.
            <br /> 
            The theme of the festival in 2022 is "Wisdom â€“ the ability to discern what is true, right or lasting".  We will consider this theme with reference to the valleys that surround the town
            <br />  <br />
            The town of Stroud is famed for lying at the junction of five Cotswold valleys.  Indeed, the phrase "the five valleys" is synonymous for Stroud area.  It is perhaps a little surprising that the identity of the five valleys is open to some dispute. A quick look at an OS map will show that many valleys converge in the general vicinity of Stroud.  Which of them are the renowned five?  In search of wisdom on the walk, we will consider the contentious issue of the number and identity of the Stroud Valleys.  We will also seek to understand how the character of Stroud has been created and influenced by the valleys.  There are stories to be told of food riots and mills, geology and streams, canals, railways, sheep and gods.
            <br />  <br />
            The walk also provides an opportunity to explore the legend of the mysterious and elusive sixth valley of Ditchley Yat.  This valley cannot be found on contemporary maps and is reputed to move from place to place, or to appear and disappear from time to time.  Legend maintains that DitchleyYat decided to hide itself to avoid paying the poll tax in 1381, and it has featured in local folklore ever since.  Can there be any truth, or perhaps any wisdom in these tales?
          </p>
          <p class="text-faded">
            We will start the walk on Wednesday 23rd of February, at 10.00am at Wallbridge (point 1 on the map). Expect to take at least 5 hours and please note the information about the ups, downs and difficulty of the route in the WAS Way guide.  <br />

          <h3>1pm Leeds UK, Tim Waters: Circular walk around medieval boundary of Leeds </h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            A return to the walk around the medieval boundary of Leeds, visiting the old stone markers (bars) and paying particular attention to the nearby
             moved, missing, open and closed Christian churches which in some cases had these markers embedded into the fabric of them. The location of the North Bar has been a common story of these walks of the years - did you know this stone was once sited into the walls of a chapel?
            <br />  <br />
            We will also hear the story of a moved cathedral and a missing skyline, visit the site of a pre-Reformation chantry chapel, pass by a vanished tee-totaller chapel, walk through graveyards and ponder about the relationship between the Trinity centre and the non-trinitarians.  
            <br />        <img src="img/past/2022/terminalia2021.png" height="300px" /><br />
            Responding to the theme of wisdom - it could be said that wisdom is a kind of applied and passed-down meaning to life - about the relationship between the spiritual life and the material world.  A church reflects this as a geographical boundary marker and a meeting place of above and below.
     
          
          </p>
          <p class="text-faded">
        
            Meet at 1pm in the beer garden (or inside if weather) of the Lamb & Flag pub by Leeds Minster. Look for the man with the bamboo cane walking stick. 
            <br />
            This circular walk around the centre of Leeds usually takes around 2 to 3 hours and there's a few steps in places, so participants should be reasonably fit. Bring warm clothes if cold.  <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/terminalia-circular-walk-around-medieval-boundary-of-leeds-tickets-260996586817">Sign up on Eventbrite</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1571965779828113/">on Facebook </a>.

          <h3> 1pm London UK, Frank Molloy:  Woody - London's Tree of Knowledge!</h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            Free walking tour in the City of London with London guide Frank Molloy.
            <br />
            <img src="img/past/2022/woody.png" height="300px">
            <br />
            The walk celebrates the famous plane tree which stands at the junction of Wood Street and Cheapside. 'Woody' is recognised as one of the oldest trees in London. Scant though records are, evidence points to it being planted at this spot 200 years ago.  
            <br />
            Over the centuries, the tree's location has had a major effect on history, literature, architecture, shopping and all manner of culture. 
            <br /> <br />
            London Guide Frank Molloy will be linking the walk to Deleuzian concepts of psychogeography and the 2022 Terminalia theme 'Wisdom'.
            <br />
            The walk includes a fantastic viewpoint of London, a visit to a City church and poetry readings.

          <p class="text-faded">

          <h3>2pm Shrewsbury UK, Roger Boyle: Shrewsbury Town Walls: circumnavigation</h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            Terminalia 2022 will be celebrated in Shrewsbury.  <br />
   
            Like many towns, physical remains of Shrewsbury town walls are all but non-existent, but modern streets permit a good guess at their course.
            <br />
            <img src="img/past/2022/shrews.jpg" height="300px"/><br />
            The route may be short, but its observance is important.
            <br />
            The first decision will be whether to travel clockwise or anti-clockwise.

          <h3>Time TBC: Beyond the Edge of Reason, A Walk for Terminalia</h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            Responding to this years Terminalia theme of Wisdom <a href="http://www.juliebrixey-williams.co.uk/">Julie Brixey -Williams</a>,  <a href="http://www.soniaoverall.net">Sonia Overall</a>   and <a href="http://www.elspeth-billie-penfold.com">Elspeth ( Billie) Penfold</a>  will be walking the Road of Remembrance in Folkestone. <a href="https://oikaspain.com/stories/">Fred Adam</a>  will be joining them in Spain.
            <br />   <a href="img/past/2022/edge_reason1.jpg"><img src="img/past/2022/edge_reason1.jpg" height="300px" /> </a><br />
            As events continue to unfold in the Ukraine and elsewhere in the world,  Sonia, Julie, Billie and Fred will be walking exploring conflict and the legacy of war. We will walk Beyond the Edge of Reason discovering playful and, maybe, not so playful  responses to rationality and reason as we engage with our chosen topic and site. 
            <br />
            We would be delighted if you could join us wherever you are and look forward to a fruitful exchange. 
            

          </p>
          <p class="text-faded">
            The project brief will be posted on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThreadandWord">Thread and Word Facebook page</a> nearer the time . We welcome you to follow our brief or feel free to interpret this invitation as you wish.

          <h3>Time TBC, Italy/Online. Bernardo Bruno: IMPERMANENCE ancient wisdom </h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            "Impermanence, according to Thich Nhat Hanh, is something we must learn to appreciate
            its value, as it teaches us to respect all the precious things that we have around and within
            us at all times and to give them the right value"
            <br /> <img src="img/past/2022/bernardo_2022.png" height="350px" /><br />

            Individually or in small groups we will create a simple writing in the sand by the sea or on
  the ground with a rake, a hoe or other useful tool. We will then take pictures of this
  impermanent sign and make a small votive offering to the God Terminus. <br /> <br />
  The frontier is the limit and the term can be expressed in many ways. This symbolic form
  also wants to be a tribute to the Zen master Tich Nhat Hanh passed away on January 21.
  The result of this action, which will take place on February 20, will then be shared a few days after February 23 (around 27th, TBC) on the web through the Google Meet platform.
          </p>
