          <h3>1pm Leeds. Circular walk around medieval boundary of Leeds </h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            A return to the walk around the medieval boundary of Leeds, visiting the old stone markers (bars) and paying particular attention to the nearby
             moved, missing, open and closed Christian churches which in some cases had these markers embedded into the fabric of them. The location of the North Bar has been a common story of these walks of the years - did you know this stone was once sited into the walls of a chapel?
            <br />  <br />
            We will also hear the story of a moved cathedral and a missing skyline, visit the site of a pre-Reformation chantry chapel, pass by a vanished tee-totaller chapel, walk through graveyards and ponder about the relationship between the Trinity centre and the non-trinitarians.

            Responding to the theme of wisdom - it could be said that wisdom is a kind of applied and passed-down meaning to life - about the relationship between the spiritual life and the material world.  A church reflects this as a geographical boundary marker and a meeting place of above and below.

            Meet at 1pm in the beer garden (or inside if weather) of the Lamb & Flag pub by Leeds Minster. Look for the man with the bamboo cane walking stick. 
            <br />
            This circular walk around the centre of Leeds usually takes around 2 to 3 hours and there's a few steps in places, so participants should be reasonably fit. Bring warm clothes if cold.  <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/terminalia-circular-walk-around-medieval-boundary-of-leeds-tickets-260996586817">Sign up on Eventbrite</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1571965779828113/">on Facebook </a>
