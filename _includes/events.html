                  <h3>6pm Leeds - Beating the Bounds: Circular walk around medieval boundary of Leeds.</h3>
                  <p class="text">6pm Departure from TBA. 2-3 hrs (90 mins walking). Bring treats to share, flowers to leave and drinks to keep you warm! With events, interventions, and special performances from local artists. Led by Tim Waters</p>
                  <p class="text-faded"> 
                  We will be walking widdershins (anti-clockwise) around the city, visiting the ancient boundary markers that defined the medieval boundaries of the city. Traditionally, feasting and dances were performed during Terminalia at boundary markers, and we will do the same with things with cake, flowers and a drink! The boundary markers around Leeds are called bars (gates, possibly that barred off an entrance) and mark the borders where the city ended and the countryside began. Some stone markers still exist.</p>
                  <h4>Performances</h4>
                  <p class="text-faded">Anzir Boodoo will perform a traditional Roman blessing at the city's transport termini. The walk may also visit the new glittering southern entrance to the railway station where an invocation to a Roman river god will be enacted as we stand over the water. </p>
