          <h3>10.30am Stroud. Radical Stroud Terminalia Walk </h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            This year, <a href="http://radicalstroud.co.uk/radical-stroud-terminalia-walk-saturday-23rd-february/">Radical Stroud</a> are carrying out a circular walk in Oakridge. In honour of Terminus we will visit the site of
            Oakridge Common. It was enclosed in 1866 against local opposition and we will view the present day boundaries with an
            eye to the past. In our usual eclectic fashion we will also take in the site of a Roman villa, a long barrow and the
            crash site of a WW2 German bomber.
            <br />
            Quiet lanes and footpaths and a few styles. A couple of steep climbs. Likely to be muddy. 2-3hours.
            <br />

          <h3>11am Seasalter, Kent: A Walk with Thread and Word in Seasalter for Terminalia </h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            Through Thread and Word we are organising a collaborative walk -  inviting participation with interventions and eco-poetry in Seasalter which is between Whitstable and Faversham in Kent. There is a proposal to build 1,000s of solar panels, along part of our route through Seasalter which will decimate the surrounding environment.
            <br />

            The walk will focus on the boundaries between alternative ways of producing energy and our surrounding environment and natural habitat. We already have a boundary sea wall to protect the surrounding land from the sea ..... as well as a boundary for fishing for bait .... (which we walked last year) and a graveyard of old Groynes to protect the beaches.
            <br />
            The walk on Saturday Feb 23rd as part of Terminalia Festival which celebrates the Roman God of boundaries Terminus, will use the surrounding countryside to explore ideas and consider where we draw the line as we try to protect our environment. We will use threads to record our thoughts as we respond to the surrounding landscape and poetry readings chosen from the eco -poetry archive to inspire our thoughts related to the area. 
            <br />
            We will end up in a local pub ðŸ˜Š where we will write a short declaration of findings it might even be a poem! I hope you can join us. 
      
          </p>
          <p class="text-faded">
            Meeting for a 11am start from outside the Sportsman in Seasalter. The walk would last about an hour and a half walking on mostly flat terrain. <br />

          <h3>12pm Barbican, London: The Act of Walking - Paving the Streets of London. </h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            This walk will start at White Cross Street but we will meet prior outside Barbican underground station at 12pm, it will last one hour, following the route of the 1542 Paving Act. Due to the walk having various stops and changing with the context of each experience, its end location remains unknown but will be somewhere along this route. The route will raise questions around human impact on the environment and urban topographies, whilst exploring the significance of the pavings history from all the way back in 1542 to the evidence of history from yesterday.  We will explore the stones themselves, the cracks in them, the litter on top, the chewing gum tarred into them and finally the pebbles and the dirt.

          <h3>Barletta, Apulia, Italy: "The Scenes of Crimini" Among the Perimeters of the Ancient Walls of Barletta </h3>
          
          
          <p class="text">
            After organizing, a few years ago, a temporary installation made of metal nets and enveloped and classified waste called "The crime scene" in Cassano Murge. The "garden of scraps" was an operation accomplished by collecting elements and garbage of all kinds and shown to the public in one of the most important squares for a few weeks. <br />

           During the Festival of Psychogeography 2018, our journey took place in the direction of Porta Marina and then we crossed the Walls of Carmine and stopped at the Paraticchio, there we laid a chaplet of symbolic laurels to practice our ritual dedicated to Terminalia. Then we went along the borders that are no longer there ... the probable track of the beaten sixteenth-century city walls. In Piazza Castello, we placed another small laurel wreath at the foot of the monument to the missing in the sea <br />
           This year for the Festival we propose a singular "walk" between the perimeter that contains very particular "boundaries" of the ancient center in the city of Barletta: "The Scenes of Crimini" Among the Perimeters of the Ancient Walls of Barletta <br />
           The crime scene proposed here is a sort of identification of very singular places within the medieval walls where they were carried out in remote times acts of brutal violence: murders, murderers etc.  We can imagine how many episodes may have occurred in ancient times in the square in front of the castle, along the walls of the Carmine, between the streets of the village! Returning through these tales and symbolic geolocalizations these particular boundaries, Pursing of the "titles" or symbolic stick stickers on the walls of the palaces, between the streets of the medieval nucleus is an operation that symbolically re-enacts buried episodes and forgotten tames ... ..In the so-called seaside village among the humble houses or the ancient palaces of civilians, between churches and buildings inhabited by monks / nuns. In the building next to the church of Sant 'Andrea, turned into a prison how many violences were consumed?  <br />In this way, we will perform a performance in which we will reactivate one of these criminal incidents, now forgotten, which took place in Barletta.
           <br />
           The episodes we will mention are:   <br />
           1) The massacre of the Terlizzesi occurred on 10 January 1899 near the disappearance "Porta Nuova", where the two brothers Baldassare da Terlizzi lost their lives  <br />
           2) Aggression to the Evangelical Community in March 1866 that cost the lives of 4 people, of which only one of evangelical faith occurred near Via del Pesce.

          <h3>4pm Leeds: Beating the Bounds - Circular walk around medieval boundary of Leeds</h3>
        
          <p class="text">
            Leeds - Beating the Bounds. Bring treats to share, flowers to leave and drinks to keep you warm! With events, interventions, and special performances from local artists. <br />
            We will be walking in an anti-clockwise direction around the city, visiting the ancient boundary stone markers that defined the medieval boundaries of the city. Traditionally, feasting and sacrifices were performed during Terminalia at boundary markers, and we will do the same with things like poetry, cake, flowers or a drink! The boundary markers around Leeds are called bars (gates, possibly that barred off an entrance) and mark the borders where the city ended and the countryside began. Most are recorded and some still exist. <br />
            This year as we will be walking during the day we will be able to see the Burley Bar Stone which is inside a bank! <br />
            (Check out <a href="/past">the previous years</a> pages to see what has happened before)  
          </p>
