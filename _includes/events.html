            <h3> 5.30pm, Leeds. Beating the Bounds Walk - Circular walk around our boundary of Leeds</h3>
          
              <p class="text">5.30pm Route planning, dowsing and map browsing for a strict 6pm departure from the bar at <!-- <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/204237011">Wharf Chambers Co-op Club</a> --> TBC. 2 hrs (easy). Bring treats to share, flowers to leave and alcoholic or soft drinks to keep you warm! With events, interventions, and special performances from local artists. Led  by Tim Waters
              </p>

              <p class="text">
                  A different format to past years, we will find our own boundary markers of the city. Using crystal dowsing techniques over maps in the bar beforehand participants will plot out a route to follow within the city centre. Walkers will then head out to explore the divined places and examine whats there and uncover boundary markers. Once done (or after a set amount of time), examining our new boundary markers and the map, we will head inwards to find the centre. At each newly found marker, we shall celebrate the boundary with snacks, drinks and flowers, do please bring some to share! 
                </p>
          
              <p class="text-faded">
                We're happy to report that 2018 finds all the medieval boundary markers of Leeds, the bars, marked with blue plaques and/or uncovered. Our actions over the years has been successful! This year we will seek to explore the city by finding new boundary markers. Previous boundary stones marked out the limits of the medieval city, and the entrances and toll booths for animals and trade. Terminus is also the god of non physical boundaries such as time and seasons and relationships. How has the city changed from ancient times - can we ask our unconcious minds where these new marks would or should be? 
              </p>
