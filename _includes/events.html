          <h3>10am Stroud, UK, Radical Stroud: A Circumnavigation of Stroud and investigation of the "Five Valleys" </h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            For the 2022 Terminalia walk we will follow the established route of the Way Around Stroud Way (WAS Way).  Please follow <a href="https://www.stroudtown.gov.uk/uploads/was-way-map-web.pdf">https://www.stroudtown.gov.uk/uploads/was-way-map-web.pdf</a> to obtain the excellent and very informative guide to the walk.  This contains a map, trail guide, height profile and concise details of the fascinating history of Stroud and the five valleys.
            <br /> 
            The theme of the festival in 2022 is "Wisdom – the ability to discern what is true, right or lasting".  We will consider this theme with reference to the valleys that surround the town
            <br />  <br />
            The town of Stroud is famed for lying at the junction of five Cotswold valleys.  Indeed, the phrase "the five valleys" is synonymous for Stroud area.  It is perhaps a little surprising that the identity of the five valleys is open to some dispute. A quick look at an OS map will show that many valleys converge in the general vicinity of Stroud.  Which of them are the renowned five?  In search of wisdom on the walk, we will consider the contentious issue of the number and identity of the Stroud Valleys.  We will also seek to understand how the character of Stroud has been created and influenced by the valleys.  There are stories to be told of food riots and mills, geology and streams, canals, railways, sheep and gods.
            <br />  <br />
            The walk also provides an opportunity to explore the legend of the mysterious and elusive sixth valley of Ditchley Yat.  This valley cannot be found on contemporary maps and is reputed to move from place to place, or to appear and disappear from time to time.  Legend maintains that DitchleyYat decided to hide itself to avoid paying the poll tax in 1381, and it has featured in local folklore ever since.  Can there be any truth, or perhaps any wisdom in these tales?
          </p>
          <p class="text-faded">
            We will start the walk on Wednesday 23rd of February, at 10.00am at Wallbridge (point 1 on the map). Expect to take at least 5 hours and please note the information about the ups, downs and difficulty of the route in the WAS Way guide.  <br />

          <p class="text">
         Patrick Ford will be walking with Dr. Nina Yiu. <br />We will walk from the Old Town of Bridlington in East Yorks, down to the old priory church and bayle gate and then follow the road that links the old town to the harbour, that was the site of the old quay. Originally the old town and the quay were two separate, but related locations whereas now they have been combined into the modern town.

          <p class="text">
            Free walking tour in the City of London with London guide Frank Molloy.

            <img src="img/past/2022/woody.png" height="300px">
            <br />
            The walk celebrates the famous plane tree which stands at the junction of Wood Street and Cheapside. 'Woody' is recognised as one of the oldest trees in London. Scant though records are, evidence points to it being planted at this spot 200 years ago.  
            <br />
            Over the centuries, the tree's location has had a major effect on history, literature, architecture, shopping and all manner of culture. 
            <br /> <br />
            London Guide Frank Molloy will be linking the walk to Deleuzian concepts of psychogeography and the 2022 Terminalia theme 'Wisdom'.
            <br />
            The walk includes a fantastic viewpoint of London, a visit to a City church and poetry readings.

          <p class="text">
            Terminalia 2022 will be celebrated in Shrewsbury.  <br />
   
            Like many towns, physical remains of Shrewsbury town walls are all but non-existent, but modern streets permit a good guess at their course.

            The route may be short, but its observance is important.
            <br />
            The first decision will be whether to travel clockwise or anti-clockwise.

          <h3>4pm. Essex University, England. Jim Morris:  Walking to Knowledge, Finding Wisdom.</h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            As part of the festival, we’re getting together to walk around campus. We are lucky to have some fine brutalist architecture and it would offer the chance to contemplate its apparent rejection of imitating nature, its softness and aesthetics.  
            <br />
            <br />

            If you’re around and would like to join in, meet us in Square 4 adjacent to The Hex at 4pm on Wednesday afternoon. The aim being to get us thinking about our connections to campus, nature, architecture, and wisdom. We even have a Knowledge Gateway on campus to visit, potentially tracing a boundary between earth and concrete. Be prepared for a dérive and bring whatever you might need to get creative.
          </p>
          <p class="text-faded">
            This is only open to students and staff of Essex University.

            As events continue to unfold in the Ukraine and elsewhere in the world,  Sonia, Julie, Billie and Fred will be walking exploring conflict and the legacy of war. We will walk Beyond the Edge of Reason discovering playful and, maybe, not so playful  responses to rationality and reason as we engage with our chosen topic and site.

          <h3>20th,23rd,27th, Italy/Online. Bernardo Bruno: IMPERMANENCE ancient wisdom </h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            "Impermanence, according to Thich Nhat Hanh, is something we must learn to appreciate
            its value, as it teaches us to respect all the precious things that we have around and within
            us at all times and to give them the right value"
            <br /> <img src="img/past/2022/bernardo_2022.png" height="350px" /><br />

            20th, 9.30AM-12.40PM. Individually or in small groups we will create a simple writing in the sand by the sea or on
  the ground with a rake, a hoe or other useful tool. We will then take pictures of this
  impermanent sign and make a small votive offering to the God Terminus. <br /> <br />
  The frontier is the limit and the term can be expressed in many ways. This symbolic form
  also wants to be a tribute to the Zen master Tich Nhat Hanh passed away on January 21.
  The result of this action, which will take place on February 20, will then be shared on the 27th at 8pm-9pm on the web through the Google Meet platform / Facebook.

          <h3><strong>Postponed to Friday 25th</strong> 1pm Leeds UK, Tim Waters: Circular walk around medieval boundary of Leeds </h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            A return to the walk around the medieval boundary of Leeds, visiting the old stone markers (bars) and paying particular attention to the nearby
             moved, missing, open and closed Christian churches which in some cases had these markers embedded into the fabric of them. The location of the North Bar has been a common story of these walks of the years - did you know this stone was once sited into the walls of a chapel?
            <br />  <br />
            We will also hear the story of a moved cathedral and a missing skyline, visit the site of a pre-Reformation chantry chapel, pass by a vanished tee-totaller chapel, walk through graveyards and ponder about the relationship between the Trinity centre and the non-trinitarians.  
            <br />        <img src="img/past/2022/terminalia2021.png" height="300px" /><br />
            Responding to the theme of wisdom - it could be said that wisdom is a kind of applied and passed-down meaning to life - about the relationship between the spiritual life and the material world.  A church reflects this as a geographical boundary marker and a meeting place of above and below.

            <br />
            This circular walk around the centre of Leeds usually takes around 2 to 3 hours and there's a few steps in places, so participants should be reasonably fit.

          <p class="text">
            Celebrate Terminalia with a walk along the southern boundary of the Burgh of Govan, which was incorporated into Glasgow 110 years ago. Terminalia is the ancient Roman festival of boundaries, held on the last day of the Roman year, when citizens and landed proprietors processed round the edges of their property and praised Terminus, the god of boundaries, hoping for continued peace and stable borders.
          </p>
