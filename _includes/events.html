          <h3>A Walk On the Edge with The Glass Onion</h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            I invite you to join me with Thread and Word.
            We will walk alone or together and take a
            view of our walking experience through a
            glass onion. You might of course prefer rose
            tinted spectacles .
            <br />
            <a href="img/past/2023/image0.jpeg"><img src="img/past/2023/image0_400px.jpeg" height="400px"></a>
            <br />
            The plan is to look for associations that might
            be hidden humorous, inspire hope or defy
            rhyme or reason. This is an invitation to
            observe, through the glass onion, the edges
            of the contradictory nature of the world that
            we presently live in .

            <br /><br />
            To be honest, onions take me to the edge. I
            think that the onion is very compatible with
            Terminalia, as a boundary to how you feel
            physically once ingested. The glass onion
            might give us a tool to explore things a little
            differently.
            <br /><br />

            You might like to carry an onion and peel it
            as you progress or you might prefer to look
            through the bottom of a glass bottle.
            <br /><br />
          
            As always feel free to interpret this invitation
            as you wish. Feel free to wander and see
            where this takes you. <br />
            I will be sharing our experience on  the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThreadandWord">Thread and Word Facebook</a> page and will be delighted to
            include yours if you are happy to share.
