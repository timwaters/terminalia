A reflection on physical boundaries and "confinement" From this year the Festival is open to all those who want to perform a ritual action inspired by the TERMINALIA, the pagan festival in honor of the God Terminus everywhere. Those who want to simultaneously on February 23 between 15 and 18 will be able to create their own Terminalia.

          Aled Singleton walked and produced a video: <br />
          This Terminalia walk is called "A4072", named after a road that goes north from Newport. Aled and his mother follow the road line from a demolished
          a cappella into a deceased pub, stopping at places where people have previously been to grab a drink and to find themselves closer to God.

          "Today I walk an imaginary line around my house. My feet don’t leave indentations to show I have done it, not since the recent snow, and when that melted, the trace was gone. Home and back, I pace and pound my boundary line, a pathway that returns to itself, reconnects, reattaches, brings me back to the garden gate." <br />

        <p class="text">
      <a href="https://sootallures.wixsite.com/topographersarms/post/colonel-despard">Radical Stroud organised a solo walk or in pairs to </a>"...to explore hidden imperial and colonial boundaries in two of the five valleys and along Nelson Street. We shall remember John Thelwall (radical visitor here in the summer of 1798), Colonel Despard (executed February 21st 1803) and Catherine Despard, African-American political activist."
        </p>
        <p class="text-faded">
          Places to visit and remember: 1. Nailsworth retirement village. 2. Chalford Bottom. 3. Bowbridge. (all by bicycle to remember how John Thelwall challenged boundaries) 4. Nelson Street: (a.) where the future General Wolfe (killed at Quebec 1759) had troops stationed ready against local weavers. (b.) Nelson Street and Trafalgar House – what names tell us and hide – the boundaries of nomenclature and ‘the naming of parts’ - (hidden history: Nelson and Despard; Nelson and the saving of his life by ‘a woman of colour’, Cubah Cornwallis; Nelson and his support for the ‘West India Interest’ and plantocracy); Black Boy Clock; the Duke of York. <br />

        <h3> Andrew Budd: Terminalia 2021 - on the brink</h3>
      
      
        <p class="text">
          <a href="https://sootallures.wixsite.com/topographersarms/post/terminalia-2021-on-the-brink"> Andrew Budd did a solo walk. </a>
          <br />

          "I’m almost out of bounds. I’m standing on the edge. I’m at the lowest point. But I’m feeling good....
          <br />
          I’m on my own today. It’s the pandemic, and I’m only allowed to walk with someone if it’s ‘exercise’. At this waterside I’m nearly half way round a five mile loop that I’d planned, and I’m fighting a blasting from the wind. It’s definitely exercise and not just a leisurely stroll. Today, I’m in a solitary mood, feeling that I need to be alone. I’m reflecting on life at present and wondering when we might get back to ‘normal’, when a group of friends can walk out together, and not have to worry about keeping our distance from each other. A time we can beat the bounds, collectively. Sounds like Terminalia 2022 will be a bigger celebration. But today, I’ve enjoyed the loneliness of the ‘enthusiast’ in a remote spot, in nature, in pursuit of his romantic ideas about history and geography, and his insignificance in the big scheme of everything else...


          <br />
          I have no garland or wine to offer to the God Terminus at this outpost boundary. But I thank him for keeping watch over me, on the brink."
