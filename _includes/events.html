          <h3>9.00 AM: New York City, USA. Line as labyrinth: Walking the urban labyrinth of desire. </h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            A labyrinth is not a maze, nor a puzzle to be solved, but a singular path to be traveled. One followed by choice.  One where the destination is clearly the journey, and time and the space for contemplation the purpose.
          <br />
          <br />

            A labyrinth is a line, often considered as a line convoluted, with compounded twists and turns.  The very word labyrinthine is a term to describe that which is complicated and intricate. But at its core, at the heart of it, a labyrinth is just a line.  One without distractions, one without choices and options.  It is a singular line to follow.  One that is chosen by the walker, not forced upon them by the built environment.  The invitation to walk a labyrinth is just that, an invitation.  It is not a demand, or even a request.  It is an option. One chosen when you feel the need, the pull, the desire. The desire to take on a path, or a pilgrimage.  To set out with an intention, a question. It works best when you don’t try to answer that question, but just walk with the question, and see how it changes, and reveals more of itself, with each footstep. 
            <br />
            <br />
            
            According to some urban planning experts, Broadway was New York City’s earliest desire line, following as it does the Native American-made Wickquasgeck Path, which is thought to have been the shortest walking route between pre-colonial settlements in Manhattan. Broadway is the only remaining one path, according to Architect and urban planner Riccardo Marini, that “wasn’t wiped out by the European grid being overlaid on it”.  In this work this path of desire becomes the line of a labyrinth progressing through the city. A singular line progressing from the most northern to the most southern tips of Manhattan.  This line becomes an urban labyrinth of desire. 
          

          </p>
          <p class="text-faded">
            Christopher Kaczmarek invites any who feel the need, pull or aspiration to undertaking a walking pilgrimage to join him down the urban labyrinth of desire that is the street of Broadway. We will begin at 09.00 on Sunday morning February 23, 2020.

          <h3>10.00am Stroud, UK. "Beating the Bounds" of Rodborough Parish </h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            In honour of the Roman God of boundaries we will walk around the limits of the parish of Rodborough.  
          </p>

            <p>
            Parishes were once very important administrative areas and ceremonially walking the boundaries of a parish (known as “Beating the Bounds”) was a significant local custom in many places.  Important boundary landmarks such as trees or stones would be ceremonially beaten with birch or willow rods.  Sometimes young boys (typically choir boys) would also be ceremonially beaten at key places (supposedly to ensure that they would remember the parish boundaries!).
          </p>
          <p>
            On this walk we intend to revive certain aspects of this custom for one day.  Specifically, walking the boundary and beating key landmarks, but most definitely NOT beating young boys.  As we progress there will be discussions and performative celebration of local matters, historical, political, industrial, cultural, geological, ecological and mythological.  The boundary of Rodborough parish follows canals and disused railway lines, makes steep ascents and descents of beautiful Cotswold valleys and crosses the limestone grassland of an ancient common.

            Approximately 8 miles.  Allow 6 hours. Bring refreshments and food. Towpaths and footpaths and some very steep climbs / descents.  Several stiles to cross. <br />
            The walk will start and end at Stroud Railway station.  Map ref SO 84973 05124.  Meet in the forecourt for a 10.00 am start.

  <h3>1.30pm: Leeds, UK. Desire Paths - walking to the stones</h3>
  <p class="text">
    We shall explore the desire lines of Leeds from Hyde Park Corner, through Woodhouse Moor, across the University campus and into the city centre.  Be on the look out for desire paths, short cuts and corrections by authorities.
    <br />
We shall finish at one of the ancient stones or "bars" in the centre of Leeds to commemorate the boundaries. 
  </p><p>
    
The Situationists (the somewhat more zany political wing of psychogeography) say that people need to become conscious of their hidden and un-expressed desires before they can reach a new world, rather than just following another set of political aims, persons or prescriptions for action.  Perhaps desire paths and lines are visible traces of people's desire of an alternate reality? Or perhaps it's just a short cut to the shops!
  </p>

  <p class="text-faded">
    Meet 1.30 in the pub garden outside the Hyde Park Corner Pub. If it's raining we will be inside the pub. Look for the man carrying a folded Ordnance Survey map.  The walk should take an hour or two. It will end in the centre of Leeds. Ground should mostly be flat and in general is downhill.

  <h3>14:00 Berlin, Germany: Erasing the line: From no man's land to tram line</h3>


  <p class="text">
    If Berlin had Terminus worshippers, who erected milestones and border
    markers, he would have been well served in the years between 1961 and
    1989 when the city was divided by a wall and in so many other ways.
    Walls, barbed wire, observation towers and even borders on the middle of
    the river were all borders set to divide the city during the Cold War.
    The people counteracted with secret tunnels and daring escapes.
  </p>
  <p>
    For Terminalia, we will explore one of the ways in which the
disappearence of the wall has enabled new life in the city, namely along
the line of the Tram M10. A large part of the tram itinerary was only
made possible because it runs for a long stretch where the no man´s land
between the Berlin Wall and East Berlin was placed. After the Wall was
gone, this empty stretch of land became a park, a site of worship and it
even has its own little field where rye is planted and harvested each
year. Life came back to the whole area -new buildings, shops, a memorial
museum, a flea market, an open air gallery, murals that stretch along
whole buildings...and the tram line M10 breathes life into all of this
new land. Also called "the party line" it connects the main train
station with two other neighbourhoods in the former East Berlin,
Prenzlauer Berg and Friedrichshain, where there is an active party and
night life. This line is as busy in the wee hours of the morning on
Fridays and Saturdays as it is during rush hour during a week day. Were
it not for the memorial site and the open air gallery, you would not
know that the Wall once determined the life of so many people by setting
borders.
  </p>
  <p>
    During Terminalia, we will walk along part of the route of M10 tram
line, exploring where reminders of these divisions still exist and where
the division is no longer visible. We invite photographers and urban
sketchers to join, to document the Festivalia activities in Berlin.
After the walk, we invite participants to a friendly exchange at a
nearby Bar or Cafe along the way, where we can share photos, sketches or
stories.
  </p>

  <h3>2pm, Arlington, Texas, USA: A Little Walkward </h3>


  <p class="text">
    Members of the feminist collective Sister Death invite friends and strangers to move with us through Veteran's Park in Arlington, Texas. We'll cross the boundary between awkward conversation and thoughtful chatting, getting to know the park and each other as we discover common ground in a era of division. Starting at the Veteran's Memorial, we'll follow the park's mile-long, accessible, paved pathway through open fields, woods, and a floral wildscape. All are welcome, including pets on leashes. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Sister Death is a band of four artists: Christine Adame, Holly D. Gray, Billi London-Gray and Marcela Reyes. As a feminist collective, we focus on empowering women and achieving gender equality. Our collective actions range from simple gestures — such as sending encouraging text messages, forwarding job opportunities, and carpooling — to complex collaborations and solidarity actions.

  <h3>2.45pm, Nijmegen, Netherlands. Terminalia Noviomagus</h3>


  <p class="text">
    The ancient Terminalia festival was celebrated on the last day of the Roman calendar year: February 23. This holiday centered on one of the oldest Roman gods, Terminus, a mysterious and largely forgotten deity who was often represented as a physical object in the form of the stone boundary markers guarding the outer limits of the Roman territory. But Terminus was imagined to hold influence over less physical boundaries too, like that between two months, or between two groups of people.
    <br /><br />
    In honor of this ancient Roman tradition, the annual Terminalia Festival of Psychogeography hosts walks exploring the theme of ‘borders’ in various locations all over the world. In the Netherlands, this year’s celebration will take place in Nijmegen, where the Romans built a military fortress around 100BC which served for almost two centuries as a flourishing border post of their Empire.
    <br /><br />
    This participatory walk with choreographic and textual elements will explore the identities of Nijmegen as a city of borders which have accumulated and transformed over the course of twenty centuries of history. Around 4.30 PM, we will halt at Café de Zon on the island of Veur-Lent. From there, participants will have the option of returning home or continuing onward to experience a specially staged denouement to Terminalia Noviomagus at sunset. At the closing of the walk, all participants are welcome to join us for the Terminalia Bacchanalia at a hipster bistro in the Honigcomplex. 
    <br /><br />

  <h3> 7PM GMT: Birmingham, UK: Dark Moon Walking</h3>


  <p class="text">
    An expedition into the darkest recesses of Stirchley and Bournville in south Birmingham. <br />

    As the New Moon begins this Terminalia, we shall reclaim the night by walking out of the street lights and into the darkest corners of Birmingham B30.<br />
    
    By day our route is green and pleasant, traversing parks, canal paths and verdant walkways. By night we shall discover how different it all looks and feels when the path is not lit, the trees loom large and all colour disappears? Will there be fear or excitement, a feeling of power or of vulnerability?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    This one-hour night walk offers the chance to venture into the unlit borderlands of Bournville, Stirchley and Lifford wards in the safety of a group. To blend into the darkness and embrace the power of our invisibility. To explore our inner fears as well as a sense of awe and wonder. By walking together, we aim to reclaim the everyday urban spaces that become off-limits after dark.<br />
    
    There will be short breaks along the way to contemplate the darkness or just to blend into the shadows, become invisible and think.<br />
    

  </p>
  <p class="text-faded">
    Organised by new <a href="http://walkspace.uk/">West Midlands walking collective, Walkspace</a>. Spaces are limited so booking is essential. The walk will start and end at Bournville train station ticket office, setting off at 7pm on Sunday 23rd February.<br />

        <p>Patrick  will be conducting a walk by the canals of Saigon, accompanied by a fellow walker - Nina Yiu Lai Lei around the canals that were once a feature of the city. Most of them have long since disappeared, some of them were filled in and became streets or boulevards such as Nguyen Hue 'Walking Street' in District 1.<br /><br />
           To commemorate this year's Terminalia festival, they will begin on Le Than Ton (which marked the old citadel wall), progress South East along Nguyen Hue, turn left along Ton Due Thang and then left again along the North Eastern side of Thi Sách. When they again reached Le Than Ton, the would then return to my starting point near to the People's Committee hall.
