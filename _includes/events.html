          <h3>TBA: New York City, USA. Line as labyrinth: Walking the urban labyrinth of desire. </h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            A labyrinth is not a maze, nor a puzzle to be solved, but a singular path to be traveled. One followed by choice.  One where the destination is clearly the journey, and time and the space for contemplation the purpose.
          <br />
          <br />

            A labyrinth is a line, often considered as a line convoluted, with compounded twists and turns.  The very word labyrinthine is a term to describe that which is complicated and intricate. But at its core, at the heart of it, a labyrinth is just a line.  One without distractions, one without choices and options.  It is a singular line to follow.  One that is chosen by the walker, not forced upon them by the built environment.  The invitation to walk a labyrinth is just that, an invitation.  It is not a demand, or even a request.  It is an option. One chosen when you feel the need, the pull, the desire. The desire to take on a path, or a pilgrimage.  To set out with an intention, a question. It works best when you don’t try to answer that question, but just walk with the question, and see how it changes, and reveals more of itself, with each footstep. 
            <br />
            <br />
            
            According to some urban planning experts, Broadway was New York City’s earliest desire line, following as it does the Native American-made Wickquasgeck Path, which is thought to have been the shortest walking route between pre-colonial settlements in Manhattan. Broadway is the only remaining one path, according to Architect and urban planner Riccardo Marini, that “wasn’t wiped out by the European grid being overlaid on it”.  In this work this path of desire becomes the line of a labyrinth progressing through the city. A singular line progressing from the most northern to the most southern tips of Manhattan.  This line becomes an urban labyrinth of desire.

          <p class="text-faded">
            Christopher Kaczmarek invites any who feel the need, pull or aspiration to undertaking a walking pilgrimage to join him down the urban labyrinth of desire that is the street of Broadway. We will begin at TBA on Sunday morning February 23, 2020. For more information contact TBA.

  <h3>3pm, Nijmegen, Netherlands. Terminalia Noviomagus</h3>


  <p class="text">
    The ancient Terminalia festival was celebrated on the last day of the Roman calendar year: February 23. This holiday centered on one of the oldest Roman gods, Terminus, a mysterious and largely forgotten deity who was often represented as a physical object in the form of the stone boundary markers guarding the outer limits of the Roman territory. But Terminus was imagined to hold influence over less physical boundaries too, like that between two months, or between two groups of people.
    <br /><br />
    In honor of this ancient Roman tradition, the annual Terminalia Festival of Psychogeography hosts walks exploring the theme of ‘borders’ in various locations all over the world. In the Netherlands, this year’s celebration will take place in Nijmegen, where the Romans built a military fortress around 100BC which served for almost two centuries as a flourishing border post of their Empire.
    <br /><br />
    This participatory walk with choreographic and textual elements will explore the identities of Nijmegen as a city of borders which have accumulated and transformed over the course of twenty centuries of history. Around 5 PM, we will halt at Café de Zon on the island of Veur-Lent. From there, participants will have the option of returning home or continuing onward to experience a specially staged denouement to Terminalia Noviomagus at sunset. At the closing of the walk, all participants are welcome to join us for the Terminalia Bacchanalia at a hipster bistro in the Honigcomplex. 
    <br /><br />
 
  </p>
  <p class="text-faded">
    Point of departure: Tony Cragg’s nameless sculpture on the Stationsplein, 3 PM <br />
    This walk is organized by Ienke Kastelein and Witold van Ratingen. <br />

        <h3>Patrick S Ford , Yiu Lai Lei, Vietnam. Saigon Canal Walk</h3>
        <p>Patrick  will be conducting a walk by the canals of Saigon, accompanied by a fellow walker - Nina Yiu Lai Lei around the canals that were once a feature of the city. Most of them have long since disappeared, some of them were filled in and became streets or boulevards such as Nguyen Hue 'Walking Street' in District 1.<br /><br />
           To commemorate this year's Terminalia festival, they will begin on Le Than Ton (which marked the old citadel wall), progress South East along Nguyen Hue, turn left along Ton Due Thang and then left again along the North Eastern side of Thi Sách. When they again reached Le Than Ton, the would then return to my starting point near to the People's Committee hall.
        <br /><br />
