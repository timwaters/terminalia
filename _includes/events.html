          <h3>1pm Leeds UK, Tim Waters: Circular walk around medieval boundary of Leeds </h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            A return to the walk around the medieval boundary of Leeds, visiting the old stone markers (bars) and paying particular attention to the nearby
             moved, missing, open and closed Christian churches which in some cases had these markers embedded into the fabric of them. The location of the North Bar has been a common story of these walks of the years - did you know this stone was once sited into the walls of a chapel?
            <br />  <br />
            We will also hear the story of a moved cathedral and a missing skyline, visit the site of a pre-Reformation chantry chapel, pass by a vanished tee-totaller chapel, walk through graveyards and ponder about the relationship between the Trinity centre and the non-trinitarians.  
            <br />        <img src="img/past/2022/terminalia2021.png" height="300px" /><br />
            Responding to the theme of wisdom - it could be said that wisdom is a kind of applied and passed-down meaning to life - about the relationship between the spiritual life and the material world.  A church reflects this as a geographical boundary marker and a meeting place of above and below.
     
          
          </p>
          <p class="text-faded">
        
            Meet at 1pm in the beer garden (or inside if weather) of the Lamb & Flag pub by Leeds Minster. Look for the man with the bamboo cane walking stick. 
            <br />
            This circular walk around the centre of Leeds usually takes around 2 to 3 hours and there's a few steps in places, so participants should be reasonably fit. Bring warm clothes if cold.  <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/terminalia-circular-walk-around-medieval-boundary-of-leeds-tickets-260996586817">Sign up on Eventbrite</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1571965779828113/">on Facebook </a>.

          <h3> 1pm London UK, Frank Molloy:  Woody - London's Tree of Knowledge!</h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            Free walking tour in the City of London with London guide Frank Molloy.
            <br />
            <img src="img/past/2022/woody.png" height="300px">
            <br />
            The walk celebrates the famous plane tree which stands at the junction of Wood Street and Cheapside. 'Woody' is recognised as one of the oldest trees in London. Scant though records are, evidence points to it being planted at this spot 200 years ago.  
            <br />
            Over the centuries, the tree's location has had a major effect on history, literature, architecture, shopping and all manner of culture. 
            <br /> <br />
            London Guide Frank Molloy will be linking the walk to Deleuzian concepts of psychogeography and the 2022 Terminalia theme 'Wisdom'.
            <br />
            The walk includes a fantastic viewpoint of London, a visit to a City church and poetry readings.

          <h3>2pm Shrewsbury UK, Roger Boyle: Shrewsbury Town Walls: circumnavigation</h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            Terminalia 2022 will be celebrated in Shrewsbury.  <br />
   
            Like many towns, physical remains of Shrewsbury town walls are all but non-existent, but modern streets permit a good guess at their course.
            <br />
            <img src="img/past/2022/shrews.jpg" height="300px"/><br />
            The route may be short, but its observance is important.
            <br />
            The first decision will be whether to travel clockwise or anti-clockwise. 
          </p>
