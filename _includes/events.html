          <h3>Afternoon.  Leeds Beating the Bounds</h3>
        
          <p class="text">
            Leeds - Beating the Bounds - Circular walk around medieval boundary of Leeds. Bring treats to share, flowers to leave and drinks to keep you warm! With events, interventions, and special performances from local artists. More details coming soon. We will be walking in an clockwise direction around the city, visiting the ancient boundary stone markers that defined the medieval boundaries of the city. Traditionally, feasting and sacrifices were performed during Terminalia at boundary markers, and we will do the same with things like poetry, cake, flowers or a drink! The boundary markers around Leeds are called bars (gates, possibly that barred off an entrance) and mark the borders where the city ended and the countryside began. Most are recorded and some still exist.

          <h3>10.30 Radical Stroud Terminalia Walk </h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            This year, Radical Stroud are carrying out a circular walk in Oakridge. In honour of Terminus we will visit the site of
            Oakridge Common. It was enclosed in 1866 against local opposition and we will view the present day boundaries with an
            eye to the past. In our usual eclectic fashion we will also take in the site of a Roman villa, a long barrow and the
            crash site of a WW2 German bomber.
            <br />
            Quiet lanes and footpaths and a few styles. A couple of steep climbs. Likely to be muddy. 2-3hours.
          </p>
