          <h3>Shoreditch UK: Elspeth Penfold: A Walk On the Edge with The Glass Onion</h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            I invite you to join me with Thread and Word.
            We will walk alone or together and take a
            view of our walking experience through a
            glass onion. You might of course prefer rose
            tinted spectacles .
            <br />

            <br />
            The plan is to look for associations that might
            be hidden humorous, inspire hope or defy
            rhyme or reason. This is an invitation to
            observe, through the glass onion, the edges
            of the contradictory nature of the world that
            we presently live in .

            <br /><br />
            To be honest, onions take me to the edge. I
            think that the onion is very compatible with
            Terminalia, as a boundary to how you feel
            physically once ingested. The glass onion
            might give us a tool to explore things a little
            differently.
            <br /><br />

            You might like to carry an onion and peel it
            as you progress or you might prefer to look
            through the bottom of a glass bottle.
            <br /><br />
          
            As always feel free to interpret this invitation
            as you wish. Feel free to wander and see
            where this takes you. <br />
            I will be sharing our experience on  the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThreadandWord">Thread and Word Facebook</a> page and will be delighted to
            include yours if you are happy to share.
          </p>

          <h3>23 Feb. 7pm Leeds: Cathy Otpangei: Terminalia Walk Around the City</h3>
        
          <p class="text">
            As an interdisciplinary practitioner, my practice is deeply rooted in the realm of psychogeography and its intersections with the urban realm. My work engages with the concept of d√©rive, which is a technique that aims to reveal the unconscious landscape of the city through drifting and exploration. 
            <br /> <br />
            For Terminalia 2023, I am proposing an immersive, interactive and site-specific event that navigates the complexities of a designated area within Leeds. Through this event, I aim to unveil the hidden narratives embedded within the urban landscape and to subvert the hegemonic structures that shape our understanding of place.
            <br />
            The event will commence with a contextualization of the designated area, utilizing cartography as a medium to highlight the key landmarks and points of interest. The participatory walk, guided by performative prompts, aims to elicit a multisensory engagement with the site and prompt the audience to question their relationship with the urban environment. 
            <br />
            The event concludes with a collective debrief where the audience can reflect on their experience, and engage in a discourse about the psychogeography of the area and its role in shaping our understanding of place.
            <br />
            The walk tour will begin at a specified locaton (TBC) and will take participants through the following places in no specific order:
            <br />
            * The Headrow: This is the main shopping street in Leeds, where walkers will be encouraged to observe and engage with the commercialized landscape and its impact on the urban environment.
            <br />
            *  Kirkgate Market: This is one of the oldest markets in Leeds, where participants will explore the history and culture of the area and its significance to the community.
            <br />
            *  The Abandoned Subway Station: This abandoned subway station that was once a hub of transportation, but has been forgotten and left to decay. People on the tour will explore the eerie atmosphere of the abandoned station and the ways in which it contributes to the sense of urban decay.
            <br />
            *  The Calls: This is a historic area of Leeds that was once a hub of industry and trade, where participants will explore the impact of industrialization on the urban landscape and the way it has shaped the city.
            <br />
            * The Secret Garden: This is a hidden garden that exists within the city, but is known only to a select few. Participants will explore the beauty of the garden and the ways in which it serves as a contrast to the urban landscape, offering a peaceful respite from the hustle and bustle of the city.
            <br />
            * The Dark Arches: This is a network of underground tunnels and arches under the Train Station that were once used for storage and transportation. Participants will explore the hidden and abandoned spaces and the way they shape the urban landscape.
            <br />
            * The Tetley: This is a former brewery that has been converted into a cultural center, where together we will learn about the history of the building and the ways in which it contributes to the cultural identity of the city.
