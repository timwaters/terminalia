          <h3>Thurs 23 Feb. Shoreditch UK: Elspeth Penfold: A Walk On the Edge with The Glass Onion</h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            I invite you to join me with Thread and Word.
            We will walk alone or together and take a
            view of our walking experience through a
            glass onion. You might of course prefer rose
            tinted spectacles .
            <br />
            <a href="img/past/2023/image0.jpeg"><img src="img/past/2023/image0_400px.jpeg" height="400px"></a>
            <br />
            The plan is to look for associations that might
            be hidden humorous, inspire hope or defy
            rhyme or reason. This is an invitation to
            observe, through the glass onion, the edges
            of the contradictory nature of the world that
            we presently live in .

            <br /><br />
            To be honest, onions take me to the edge. I
            think that the onion is very compatible with
            Terminalia, as a boundary to how you feel
            physically once ingested. The glass onion
            might give us a tool to explore things a little
            differently.
            <br /><br />

            You might like to carry an onion and peel it
            as you progress or you might prefer to look
            through the bottom of a glass bottle.
            <br /><br />
          
            As always feel free to interpret this invitation
            as you wish. Feel free to wander and see
            where this takes you. <br />
            I will be sharing our experience on  the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThreadandWord">Thread and Word Facebook</a> page and will be delighted to
            include yours if you are happy to share.
          </p>

            I will be walking in Shoreditch.

          <h3>Thurs 23 Feb. 10am. Osaka. Japan: Widdershins Osaka! 2023 </h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            Like a discarded wrapper from a Family Mart riceball,
            Widdershins Osaka! drifts through the city streets on
            gusty February days. 
            <br />
            <img src="img/past/2023/widdershins_osaka.png" height="400px"><br />
            <br />
            After a hiatus of a year or two
            the Terminalian Widdershins Organising Committee
            (TWOC) has recently convened to confirm that this
            year they will drift again. And we are all invited. But
            who and what is TWOC? TWOC are archaeologists
            of the near-future. On their knees, hunched over
            unstable terrain and fuelled by nothing more than
            black coffee and good cheesecake, they
            painstakingly remove the sediments of yesterday to
            reveal the lost image of tomorrow. 

            
            Details of this
            year’s gathering are still unclear but so far this much
            is known: on the morning of Thursday, February 23rd
            TWOC will assemble in central Osaka for a few
            hours of urban meander, encounter and interaction.
            So let's put the date in our diaries and wait for further
            details.

          <h3> Thurs 23 Feb. 1pm. Stroud: Radical Stroud, Boundaries & Barrows,  A Walk Exploring the Earthworks of Minchinhampton Common</h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            There are many earthworks on Minchinhampton Common.  A glance at an OS map reveals Mounds, Barrows, Enclosures, Tumps, and the enigmatic banks and ditches of the “Bulwarks”.  
            <br />
            <img src="img/past/2023/stroud_barrow.jpg" height="400px"><br />
            As a contribution to the Terminalia Festival 2023, Radical Stroud will undertake a circular walk to explore and celebrate these features.  We will visit many of the prominent earthworks on the common and consider explanations for their existence. Theories both archaeological and folkloric, old and new, will be discussed and debated.    New ideas are particularly welcome. We may even perform a ritual or two, honour Terminus or other local deities. 
          </p>
          <p class="text-faded">
            Difficulty - The common is a level plateau for the most part. There are fine views of the Stroud valleys. The route will take place over some golf course areas, patches of rough grassland and the banks and ditches of some of the earthworks.  No stiles or fences.  This will be a leisurely walk of about 3.5km/2m. 
            <br />

            There will be an opportunity for refreshments in the pubs of Amberley after the walk. 
            <br />
            
            Start (13.00) from the War Memorial at Amberley & Finish (approximately 15.30) - at the same place.

          <h3>Thurs 23 Feb. 7pm Leeds: Cath Otpangei: Terminalia Walk Around the City</h3>
        
          <p class="text">
            As an interdisciplinary practitioner, my practice is deeply rooted in the realm of psychogeography and its intersections with the urban realm. My work engages with the concept of dérive, which is a technique that aims to reveal the unconscious landscape of the city through drifting and exploration. 
            <br /> <br />    
           <img src="img/past/2023/cath.png" height="400px">
            <br />
            For Terminalia 2023, I am proposing an immersive, interactive and site-specific event that navigates the complexities of a designated area within Leeds. Through this event, I aim to unveil the hidden narratives embedded within the urban landscape and to subvert the hegemonic structures that shape our understanding of place.            The event will commence with a contextualization of the designated area, utilizing cartography as a medium to highlight the key landmarks and points of interest. The participatory walk, guided by performative prompts, aims to elicit a multisensory engagement with the site and prompt the audience to question their relationship with the urban environment.             The event concludes with a collective debrief where the audience can reflect on their experience, and engage in a discourse about the psychogeography of the area and its role in shaping our understanding of place.
            <br />
            The walk tour will begin at a pre-specified locaton (details sent to participants before) and will take participants through the following places in no specific order:
            <br />
            * The Headrow: This is the main shopping street in Leeds, where walkers will be encouraged to observe and engage with the commercialized landscape and its impact on the urban environment.
            <br />
            *  Kirkgate Market: This is one of the oldest markets in Leeds, where participants will explore the history and culture of the area and its significance to the community.
            <br />
            *  The Abandoned Subway Station: This abandoned subway station that was once a hub of transportation, but has been forgotten and left to decay. People on the tour will explore the eerie atmosphere of the abandoned station and the ways in which it contributes to the sense of urban decay.
            <br />
            *  The Calls: This is a historic area of Leeds that was once a hub of industry and trade, where participants will explore the impact of industrialization on the urban landscape and the way it has shaped the city.
            <br />
            * The Secret Garden: This is a hidden garden that exists within the city, but is known only to a select few. Participants will explore the beauty of the garden and the ways in which it serves as a contrast to the urban landscape, offering a peaceful respite from the hustle and bustle of the city.
            <br />
            * The Dark Arches: This is a network of underground tunnels and arches under the Train Station that were once used for storage and transportation. Participants will explore the hidden and abandoned spaces and the way they shape the urban landscape.
            <br />
            * The Tetley: This is a former brewery that has been converted into a cultural center, where together we will learn about the history of the building and the ways in which it contributes to the cultural identity of the city.

          <h3>Thurs 23 Feb. Solo performance: Patrick Ford: '20 Minute Diameter Leeds' </h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            On Thursday 23rd February, Patrick will walk a roughly circular route around Leeds in West Yorkshire. To mark the festival this year, Patrick will walk the route of a walking web he made in Leeds for a project presented by <a href="https://www.wildlyidle.com/walkingwebs">Mathilda Guerin</a> at the <a href="https://www.4wcop.org/">2022 4th World Congress of Psychogeography</a>. <br />
            <img src="img/past/2023/patrick_ford.png" height="400px"><br />
            Patrick created a map indicating way points representing the location reached after walking 10 & 20 minutes North, South, East and West. For Terminalia 2023, Patrick will walk a clockwise, circular route, linking up all of the 10 minute way points, beginning near to the College of Building on North Street. 
          </p>
          <p class="text-faded">

          <h3>Fri 24 Feb. Your shopping mall: Nicola Mazzuia - NON-PLACES TOUR (THE MALL) </h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
           <i> Wandering through a shopping mall as an act of rebellion. </i>
           <br />
           <img src="img/past/2023/non-places.jpg" height="400px">
           <br />
           Everyone will walk around the mall alone, but at the same time, we will share the experience through the Telegram channel. You will be led by a voice that will propose reflections and practical exercises. 
           <br />
           It is going to be a 'psychedelic' journey in the etymological sense: we aim to bring light through the psyche, to break preconfigured patterns in order to see things from a new perspective. 
           <br />
           We are going to deal with a bunch of contradictions through the observation of ourselves in space, triggering reflections on our lives both physical and virtual.
           <br />
           At a particular time such as the one we are living through, the sense of this experience echoes in the words of Eduardo Kohn: 'and it is precisely this upheaval, the breaking of old habits and the reconstruction of new ones, that constitutes our feeling of being alive and in the world. The world reveals itself to us not because we have habits, but in the moments when forced to abandon old habits, we assume new ones'.

          </p>
          <p class="text-faded">
            To participate, you must go to the nearest shopping centre on Friday 24 February at 2 pm. We will all start together in front of the entrance, (or rather in front of the entrances, ideally a different one for each participant).  <br />

            You must have an internet connection on your mobile phone, have the Telegram application installed, and have joined the channel:

          <h3>Sat 25 Feb. 1.30pm. Scotland. Tamsin Grainger & Ewan Dawson: A Terminalia community walk along the Edinburgh / East Lothian border  </h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            Come with us to celebrate Terminalia (or near enough) as we look for the invisible line that marks the edges of Edinburgh and East Lothian.
            Along the way we'll encounter hermits, skylarks, horses, incinerators, filmmakers and probably some mud (bring suitable footwear and your own libations and feasting materials). <br />
          
            <img src="img/past/2023/tamsin.png" height="400px"><br />
            Starting point - car park of Booker Cash and Carry, on the left between Eastfield and Musselburgh (bus routes 26, 44, and various East Lothian County Buses). 
            End point - either Newcraighall village, Fort Kinnaird shopping centre (both are on the Lothian Regional Transport bus route 30), or Shawfair railway station depending on your stamina and inclination.  <br />
            There is not much in the way of refreshments and loos on route but we will route via Newhailes National Trust for Scotland (which has loos) and a faux pub at Newcraighall (The Cuddie Brae) which will offer a potential alternative terminus for those who have tired of spoil heaps and culverts.<br />
            On the day some thought might be given to using the train for the last part of the route between Newcraighall and Shawfair stations.<br />
            We've designed this as a uni-directional walk but a round-trip can be completed by taking the train back from either of these to Brunstane British Rail and either catching #44 bus or walking to where we started.

          <h3>Sun 26 Feb. 2.30pm. Bristol: Sam Jenks / Paul Bradley. Queerscapes Terminalia</h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            A walk to bring together LGBTQ+ writers to consider the city, the urban environment and how we write about it. To explore what opportunities it offers us to bring the city alive in our writing. I also want to tease Terminus a bit to be honest, he's all rules and boundaries, but like in Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson books, I reckon Terminus has a soft spot for people who use their quickness of mind to bend around them. We can do that!  The activity is meant to fun, absurd even. And please be gentle with me, I've never done anything like this before!
            <img src="img/past/2023/bristol.jpg" height="300px"><br />
          </p>
          <p class="text-faded">
            We will meet at the Watershed Cafe, Bristol, from 2.30pm and then at 3pm head off on a pretty random walk through the old city and touching on the old city boundaries and then beyond and on to Old Market.<br />

            Along the way, it's very much up to who is there and the direction we take but these are some of the things I've made a note of and might be doing:<br />
            
            - listening to other walkers stories about how they relate to the city<br />
            - thinking about actual boundaries and how they might have shaped the LGBTQ+ layers of the city. <br />
            - looking out for city boundary stones and markers.<br />
            - talking with others about the queer geography of the city, how I relate to it as a gay man.<br />
            - looking out for lines of desire.<br />
            - refer to the Outstories App of LGBT+ Bristol<br />
            - map my walk on an app I have on my phone<br />
            - makes notes as I go along include photographs, sound recordings, written notes.<br />
            - collect archival material should the opportunity arise.<br />
            - finish up at either Wardrobe Theatre or Old Market Tavern (tbc) for drinks , snacks, where we share our stories, interpretations and responses to the walk.
