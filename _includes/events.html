          <h3>10.30am: Stroud. Radical Stroud Terminalia Walk </h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            This year, Radical Stroud are carrying out a circular walk in Oakridge. In honour of Terminus we will visit the site of
            Oakridge Common. It was enclosed in 1866 against local opposition and we will view the present day boundaries with an
            eye to the past. In our usual eclectic fashion we will also take in the site of a Roman villa, a long barrow and the
            crash site of a WW2 German bomber.
            <br />
            Quiet lanes and footpaths and a few styles. A couple of steep climbs. Likely to be muddy. 2-3hours.

          <h3>Seasalter. A Walk with Thread and Word in Seasalter for Terminalia </h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            Through Thread and Word we are organising a collaborative walk -  inviting participation with interventions and eco-poetry in Seasalter which is between Whitstable and Faversham in Kent. There is a proposal to build 1,000s of solar panels, along part of our route through Seasalter which will decimate the surrounding environment.
            <br />

            The walk will focus on the boundaries between alternative ways of producing energy and our surrounding environment and natural habitat. We already have a boundary sea wall to protect the surrounding land from the sea ..... as well as a boundary for fishing for bait .... (which we walked last year) and a graveyard of old Groynes to protect the beaches.
            <br />
            The walk on Saturday Feb 23rd as part of Terminalia Festival which celebrates the Roman God of boundaries Terminus, will use the surrounding countryside to explore ideas and consider where we draw the line as we try to protect our environment. We will use threads to record our thoughts as we respond to the surrounding landscape and poetry readings chosen from the eco -poetry archive to inspire our thoughts related to the area. 
            <br />
            We will end up in a local pub ðŸ˜Š where we will write a short declaration of findings it might even be a poem! I hope you can join us.

          <h3>4pm:  Leeds. Beating the Bounds</h3>
        
          <p class="text">
            Leeds - Beating the Bounds - Circular walk around medieval boundary of Leeds. Bring treats to share, flowers to leave and drinks to keep you warm! With events, interventions, and special performances from local artists. <br />
            We will be walking in an anti-clockwise direction around the city, visiting the ancient boundary stone markers that defined the medieval boundaries of the city. Traditionally, feasting and sacrifices were performed during Terminalia at boundary markers, and we will do the same with things like poetry, cake, flowers or a drink! The boundary markers around Leeds are called bars (gates, possibly that barred off an entrance) and mark the borders where the city ended and the countryside began. Most are recorded and some still exist. <br />
            This year as we will be walking during the day we will be able to see the Burley Bar Stone which is inside a bank! <br />
            (Check out <a href="/past">the previous years</a> pages to see what has happened before)  
          </p>
          <p class="text-faded">
            Meet at 3.45 at the <a href="http://www.northbar.com/">North Bar</a> pub on New Briggate. We will leave on the dot at 4pm. The walk usually takes between 2 and 3 hours. <br />
            Bring flowers to lay and drinks and food to share.
          </p>
     
          <h4>Beating the Bounds: Additional Interventions and Performances</h4>

          <p class="text-faded">
            <a href="https://twitter.com/anzrboo">Anzir Boodoo</a> will perform a traditional Roman blessing at a

          <h3>Patrick S Ford: Saigon Citadel Walk</h3>
          <p>Patrick will be conducting a walk in District 1 of the city, accompanied by a fellow walker - Nina Yiu Lai Lei - and they shall circumnavigate the site of a previous citadel that was destroyed in 1859. Patrick has plotted the location and worked out a route that would follow the line of the original outer walls of the citadel, recording the walk with photographs, sound recordings, ambient colours.
