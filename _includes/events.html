          <h3>10.30am Stroud. Radical Stroud Terminalia Walk </h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            This year, <a href="http://radicalstroud.co.uk/radical-stroud-terminalia-walk-saturday-23rd-february/">Radical Stroud</a> are carrying out a circular walk in Oakridge. In honour of Terminus we will visit the site of
            Oakridge Common. It was enclosed in 1866 against local opposition and we will view the present day boundaries with an
            eye to the past. In our usual eclectic fashion we will also take in the site of a Roman villa, a long barrow and the
            crash site of a WW2 German bomber.
            <br />
            Quiet lanes and footpaths and a few styles. A couple of steep climbs. Likely to be muddy. 2-3hours.
            <br />

          <h3>Patrick S Ford, Vietnam. Saigon Citadel Walk</h3>
          <p>Patrick will be conducting a walk in District 1 of the city, accompanied by a fellow walker - Nina Yiu Lai Lei - and they shall circumnavigate the site of a previous citadel that was destroyed in 1859. Patrick has plotted the location and worked out a route that would follow the line of the original outer walls of the citadel, recording the walk with photographs, sound recordings, ambient colours.
