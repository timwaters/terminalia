          <h3>Tues 20 Feb. Bath UK: Radical Stroud: Festival of Terminalia </h3>
   
          <p class="text">
            Radical Stroud intend to contribute to the Festival of Terminalia with a visit to Bath and John Thelwall’s gravestone. We shall then recreate the events of Citizen John’s last lecture and his death as we slip down wormholes of time. This Terminalia Festival walk will follow in the wake of literary, historical and political topographers – in the words of Lee Jackson in Dickensland, “Literary tourism has itself been described as ‘necromanticism’ – a ghostly communion with the dead author and their work – the real world haunted by the ghosts of fiction.’
<br/><br/>
            Meet outside the main door of Bath Abbey at 11.30. We shall then walk to Walcot Churchyard; thence to the site of the Bath Royal Literary and Scientific Institution (no longer there, destroyed in the Bath Blitz of 1942, but it was near the Parade Gardens, Manvers and Pierrepont Streets.). This is where Thelwall gave his final lecture. We then saunter up Sion Hill to Winifred House, the school & home of his regular host in Bath, the Rev. William Hutchins (bombed in WW2; now Bath Spa University); this will take about 35 minutes.
            <br/><br/>     
            This happened in late February 1834. Thelwall died, not quite seventy, on the night following his last lecture. Professor Judith Asta Thompson comments: ‘In his youth he had made a deal with his friend, Dr. Astley Cooper, that he would let him have his heart for scientific purposes (Thelwall's heart beat so loud that it could be heard by passers-by in the street). This seems not to have happened. Maybe you can still hear it ...’

          <h3>Fri Feb 23rd. 10:00am. East Kent. Thread and Word: Push Me Pull You: A Walk for Terminalia </h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            Our Push Me Pull You Walk is a walk  that looks two ways. We will walk with the past in front of us and the future behind us.<br/>  <br/>  
            We will use a walking deck of cards, A Refracted View. These were written in 2021 with  East Kent Mencap members who are adults with learning disabilities and were supported by artists from Thread and Word. These prompts give us an opportunity to explore our different perspectives across time. <br/>   <a href="/img/past/2024/push_me_pull_you_orig.jpg"><img src="/img/past/2024/push_me_pull_you_small.jpg" /> </a>
            <br/>  
            The Push Me Pull You walk for Terminal 2024, will trigger memory and  tinker with our imaginations as we walk together. As we push or pull through the boundaries of time, our materials are people and place, our stories crafted through a creative deck of walking prompts written in 2021 will now be documented through photo journaling by people from East Kent Mencap in 2024.
            <br/>   <br/>  
            The focus of this walk is sustainability; environmental and social. In 2024 the people from East Kent Mencap, with Thread and Word, will create a photo journal that continues to push and pull at the boundaries of time.
          </p>
          <p class="text-faded">
            Please meet at the East Kent Mencap Herne Bay Hub on February 23rd at 10.00 am <br>

          <h3>Fri Feb 23rd. 13:00pm: Radical Stroud: A walk around Brimpsfield and a visit to the upper reaches of the river Frome.  </h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            The theme for 2024 is “Time”.  Radical Stroud will explore this by visiting  Brimpsfield, a small Cotswold village with a remarkable past.  We will pass the site of Brimpsfield Castle, the seat of the Giffard family for about 200 years, it was demolished on the orders of Edward II in 1322 and has been just a mote and mound of rubble for the last 700 years. Adjacent to the castle site is the Church of St Michael which dates from the 12th century.
            <br/>   <br/> 
            We will also consider the boundaries aspect of Terminalia by descending the valley of the upper reaches of the river Frome.  Brimpsfield is close to the Great British Watershed.   All the waters near Brimpsfield flow to the Frome and then west into the Bristol channel.  A short distance away over the high ground, all the waters flow into the river Churn, and east to the Thames.
            <br/> 
            In the valley we will pass the site of an early Norman Motte (predating the castle) before returning to the village.
          </p>
          <p class="text-faded">
            13.00 – 15.30.  Distance - approximately 3.5km <br/> 
            Terrain – flat and level in the village, a descending footpath in the valley and a short ascent via a bridal way. The footpath may be muddy.<br/> 
            Meet at Brimpsfield Village Hall -free parking but a donations to the upkeep of the hall are welcome (donation box on site) ///clef.fancy.wicked SO 93859 12782  East 393858 North 212781<br/> 
            Bring refreshments. None are available in the village. Unfortunately Brimpsfield is not accessible by public transport.

          <h3>Fri Feb 23. Patrick Ford: Solo Performance: "40 Minute Diameter Leeds"</h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            On Friday 23rd February, Patrick will walk a roughly circular route around Leeds in West Yorkshire to mark the occasion of the year's incarnation of the annual Terminalia Festival 2024.
            <br/><br/>  
            To mark the festival this year, Patrick will walk the larger route of a walking web he made in Leeds for a project presented by <a href="https://www.wildlyidle.com/walkingwebs">Mathilda Guerin</a> at the 2022 <a href="https://www.4wcop.org/">4th World Congress of Psychogeography</a>. Patrick created a map indicating way points representing the location reached after walking 10 & 20 minutes North, South, East and West. <br/>
            For Terminalia 2024, Patrick will walk a clockwise, circular route, linking up all of the 20 minute way points, beginning at the Sheepscar junction, north of the city centre. 
          </p>
