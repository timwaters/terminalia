          <h3>Tues 20 Feb. Bath UK: Radical Stroud: Festival of Terminalia </h3>
   
          <p class="text">
            Radical Stroud intend to contribute to the Festival of Terminalia with a visit to Bath and John Thelwall’s gravestone. We shall then recreate the events of Citizen John’s last lecture and his death as we slip down wormholes of time. This Terminalia Festival walk will follow in the wake of literary, historical and political topographers – in the words of Lee Jackson in Dickensland, “Literary tourism has itself been described as ‘necromanticism’ – a ghostly communion with the dead author and their work – the real world haunted by the ghosts of fiction.’
<br/><br/>
            Meet outside the main door of Bath Abbey at 11.30. We shall then walk to Walcot Churchyard; thence to the site of the Bath Royal Literary and Scientific Institution (no longer there, destroyed in the Bath Blitz of 1942, but it was near the Parade Gardens, Manvers and Pierrepont Streets.). This is where Thelwall gave his final lecture. We then saunter up Sion Hill to Winifred House, the school & home of his regular host in Bath, the Rev. William Hutchins (bombed in WW2; now Bath Spa University); this will take about 35 minutes.
            <br/><br/>     
            This happened in late February 1834. Thelwall died, not quite seventy, on the night following his last lecture. Professor Judith Asta Thompson comments: ‘In his youth he had made a deal with his friend, Dr. Astley Cooper, that he would let him have his heart for scientific purposes (Thelwall's heart beat so loud that it could be heard by passers-by in the street). This seems not to have happened. Maybe you can still hear it ...’

          <h3>Fri Feb 23. Patrick Ford: Solo Performance: "40 Minute Diameter Leeds"</h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            On Friday 23rd February, Patrick will walk a roughly circular route around Leeds in West Yorkshire to mark the occasion of the year's incarnation of the annual Terminalia Festival 2024.
            <br/><br/>  
            To mark the festival this year, Patrick will walk the larger route of a walking web he made in Leeds for a project presented by <a href="https://www.wildlyidle.com/walkingwebs">Mathilda Guerin</a> at the 2022 <a href="https://www.4wcop.org/">4th World Congress of Psychogeography</a>. Patrick created a map indicating way points representing the location reached after walking 10 & 20 minutes North, South, East and West. <br/>
            For Terminalia 2024, Patrick will walk a clockwise, circular route, linking up all of the 20 minute way points, beginning at the Sheepscar junction, north of the city centre.
