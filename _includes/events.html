          <h3>11am, Seasalter, nr Whistable.  Walking with The Waste Land </h3>
        
        
          <p class="text">
            On Friday the 23rd of February,
            members from the walking group
            Walking with The Waste Land and their
            friends will be conducting a walk from
            the Sportsman Car Park in Seasalter,
            near Whitstable, in Kent. We will meet at
            11a.m. in order to catch the low tide at
            11.47.
          </p>
          <p>
            On this walk we will walk to "Mick’s
            post" from here we will experiment with
            some low tide mud walking, using knots
            in ropes to record the experience. <br />
            We will then return to Mick’s post where
            where we will tie the knotted ropes to
            Mick’s post in a symbolic ritual of the celebration of Terminus.

          </p>
          <p class="text-faded">
            Mick’s post is a white post in Seasalter which has been erected near the sea wall to indicate the
            boundary for the digging of bait in the estuary. <br />

            The town map is very clear to this day, and various historical sources
            <a class="" href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-433-1/dissemination/jpg/coremaps/Aberystwyth_2.jpg">confirm the course</a> as:

            <h3> 5.30pm, Leeds. Beating the Bounds Walk - Circular walk around our boundary of Leeds</h3>
          
              <p class="text">5.30pm Route planning, dowsing and map browsing for a strict 6pm departure from the bar at  <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/204237011">Wharf Chambers Co-op Club</a> . 2 hrs (easy). Bring treats to share, flowers to leave and alcoholic or soft drinks to keep you warm! With events, interventions, and special performances from local artists. Led  by Tim Waters
              </p>

              <p class="text">
                  A slightly different format to past years, we will find, in addition to the medieval stones, our own boundary markers of the city. Using crystal dowsing techniques over maps in the bar beforehand participants will plot out a route to follow within the city centre. Walkers will then head out to explore the divined places and examine whats there and uncover boundary indicators. Once done (or after a set amount of time), examining our new boundary markers and the map, we will head inwards to find the centre. At each newly found marker, we shall celebrate the boundary with snacks, drinks and flowers, do please bring some to share! 
                </p>
          
              <p class="text-faded">
                We're happy to report that 2018 finds all the medieval boundary markers of Leeds, the bars, marked with blue plaques and/or uncovered. Our actions over the years has been successful! This year we will seek in addition to explore the city by finding new boundary places. The medieval boundary stones marked out the limits of the medieval city, and the entrances and toll booths for animals and trade. Terminus is also the god of non physical boundaries such as time and seasons and relationships. How has the city changed from ancient times - can we ask our unconcious minds where these new marks would or should be? 
              </p>

    

            <h4>Beating the Bounds: Additional Interventions and Performances</h4>

            <h3>   6.30pm, London, Tapping Into The City: Group Walk - Stratford </h3>
            
  
            <p class="text">
          Tapping Into The City looks at our movements through private-public space in the city, the impact of urban surroundings on us and our relations with each other.
          <br />
              Come and join in this live art piece - a group walk around Stratford - one of London's most overtly regenerated areas and centres of privatised-public space (Westfield Stratford City, Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and East Village are all within walking distance).
          </p>
          <p class="text">
          Friday 23rd February, 6.30pm. Meeting point - at the bottom of the Meridian Steps (the stairs leading up to Westfield, next to the bus and underground station and opposite Stratford Centre).
          <br />
          Nathania will explain the piece and then we'll walk together for an hour or so, simply moving as one through the city space, listening to its sound and the sound of our feet. Afterwards we can retreat to a warm pub nearby. Ideally we'll wear shoes with pennies stuck to the soles.
          </p>
          <p class="text-faded">
          All welcome! Free, but please book on Eventbrite to secure your space - <a class="btn btn-primary " href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/terminalia-festival-tapping-into-the-city-group-walk-stratford-tickets-42866867956">Tapping Into the City - Tickets  (Eventbrite)</a>
