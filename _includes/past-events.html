                        <h4> Leeds - Beating the Bounds 6pm eeting in The North Bar Pub, North Street, then around the city. Free. </h4>

                        Leeds - Beating the Bounds - Circular walk around medieval boundary of Leeds. Bring treats to share, flowers to leave and drinks to keep you warm! With events, interventions, and special performances from local artists. More details coming soon. We will be walking in an clockwise direction around the city, visiting the ancient boundary stone markers that defined the medieval boundaries of the city. Traditionally, feasting and sacrifices were performed during Terminalia at boundary
                        markers, and we will do the same with things like poetry, cake, flowers or a drink! The boundary markers around Leeds are called bars (gates, possibly that barred off an entrance) and mark the borders where the city ended and the countryside began. Most are recorded and some still exist.

                        <h5> Simon Bradley: Displacement Activity</h5>
                        A special Displacement Activities intervention involving the group participating in a sonic boundary ritual will occur at some undisclosed part of the walk.

                        <h5> Performances</h5>
                        Anzir Boodoo will perform a traditional Roman blessing at the city's transport termini. The walk may also visit the new glittering southern entrance to the railway station where an invocation to a Roman river god will be enacted as we stand over the water.

                        <h5>Mapping the intangible.</h5>
                        This year our walk will include the opportunity to contribute to a new map of the city which will endeavor to contain some of our thoughts, feelings, memories and insights about the experience of Leeds. Liz Cable, Senior Lecturer in Digital Narratives at Leeds Trinity University will collate and curate your responses to the prompts of the city, and your experience of the Festival: photographs, doodles, memories, prose, poetry, sounds, commentary. What memories do we leave behind as as we walk into the new year. What wishes do we have for this city? Our collection will be mapped onto the city using augmented reality and available for download and re-experience as a mobile app.

                      We will be walking in an anti-clockwise direction (widdershins) this year around the city, visiting the ancient boundary markers that defined the medieval boundaries of the city. Traditionally, feasting and sacrifices were performed during Terminalia at boundary markers, and we will do the same with things like poetry, cake, flowers or a drink. The boundary markers around Leeds are called bars (gates, possibly that barred off an entrance) and mark the borders where the city ended and the countryside began. Most are recorded and some still exist.

                      CELEBRATE TERMINALIA - the festival of Terminus - Roman god of boundaries on Saturday 23rd February, 2pm Leeds.

  We will be walking in a clockwise direction around the city, visiting the ancient boundary markers that defined the medieval boundaries of the city. Traditionally, feasting and sacrifices were performed during Terminalia at boundary markers, and we will do the same with things like poetry, cake, flowers or a drink! The boundary markers around Leeds are called bars (gates, possibly that barred off an entrance) and mark the borders where the city ended and the countryside began. Most are recorded and some still exist. In addition to the historical boundaries that we encounter, you are invited to discover the hidden and not so hidden boundaries and borders that are concrete, social, political or virtual in the city.

  Meet at 2:00 for a 2:15 departure at the North Bar bar (24 New Briggate) then clockwise to the East Bar by the Parish Church, then onto the South Bar, (Adelphi comfort stop) then to the West Bar, near City Square and onto the Burley Bar (Woodhouse Lane, and should be viewable this year!) and completing the circle back at the North Bar for further festivities.
