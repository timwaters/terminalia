          This year, <a href="http://radicalstroud.co.uk/radical-stroud-terminalia-walk-saturday-23rd-february/">Radical Stroud</a> are carrying out a circular walk in Oakridge. In honour of Terminus we will visit the site of
          Oakridge Common. It was enclosed in 1866 against local opposition and we will view the present day boundaries with an
          eye to the past. In our usual eclectic fashion we will also take in the site of a Roman villa, a long barrow and the
          crash site of a WW2 German bomber.
          <br />
          Quiet lanes and footpaths and a few styles. A couple of steep climbs. Likely to be muddy. 2-3hours.

        <h3>10.30am Glasgow, Scotland. Terminalia Glasguensis (Terminalia of Glasgow) </h3>
        
        
        <p class="text">
          Celebrate Terminalia Glasguensis on Saturday 23 February with a walk around the boundaries of the ancient town, following the River Clyde, the Molendinar and the St Enoch Burn. Terminalia is the ancient Roman festival of boundaries, held on the last day of the Roman year, when citizens and landed proprietors processed round the edges of their property and praised Terminus, the god of boundaries, for continued peace and stable borders.
        </p>
        <p class="text-faded">
          The walk begins in Glasgow city centre at 10.30 am, and will last around three hours. Bring drinks and snacks to share, and a small item to leave behind at a boundary point. 
        </p>

        <h3>11am Seasalter, Kent: A Walk with Thread and Word in Seasalter for Terminalia </h3>
        
        
        <p class="text">
          Through Thread and Word we are organising a collaborative walk -  inviting participation with interventions and eco-poetry in Seasalter which is between Whitstable and Faversham in Kent. There is a proposal to build 1,000s of solar panels, along part of our route through Seasalter which will decimate the surrounding environment.
          <br />

          The walk will focus on the boundaries between alternative ways of producing energy and our surrounding environment and natural habitat. We already have a boundary sea wall to protect the surrounding land from the sea ..... as well as a boundary for fishing for bait .... (which we walked last year) and a graveyard of old Groynes to protect the beaches.
          <br />
          The walk on Saturday Feb 23rd as part of Terminalia Festival which celebrates the Roman God of boundaries Terminus, will use the surrounding countryside to explore ideas and consider where we draw the line as we try to protect our environment. We will use threads to record our thoughts as we respond to the surrounding landscape and poetry readings chosen from the eco -poetry archive to inspire our thoughts related to the area. 
          <br />
          We will end up in a local pub 😊 where we will write a short declaration of findings it might even be a poem! I hope you can join us. 
    
        </p>
        <p class="text-faded">
          Meeting for a 11am start from outside the Sportsman in Seasalter. The walk would last about an hour and a half walking on mostly flat terrain. <br />
          Also visit the <a href="https://www.faversham.org/events/arts-and-music/a-walk-for-terminalia-with-thread-and-word">Faversham council listing</a> of the walk.

        <h3>12pm Barbican, London: The Act of Walking - Paving the Streets of London. </h3>
        
        
        <p class="text">
          This walk will start at White Cross Street but we will meet prior outside Barbican underground station at 12pm, it will last one hour, following the route of the 1542 Paving Act. Due to the walk having various stops and changing with the context of each experience, its end location remains unknown but will be somewhere along this route. The route will raise questions around human impact on the environment and urban topographies, whilst exploring the significance of the pavings history from all the way back in 1542 to the evidence of history from yesterday.  We will explore the stones themselves, the cracks in them, the litter on top, the chewing gum tarred into them and finally the pebbles and the dirt.

        <p class="text">
          Join us on an mission to find The Infinite Lawn, a surreal exploration into urban sprawl and the continued
          greyifaction of the urban environment, as we attempt to walk a seamless greenbelt through the city by only
          permitting grass, moss or other flora to pass underfoot. <br />
      
          Taking our cue from Italo Calvino's novel Mr. Palomar, we will practically explore the questions the novel raises
          around the symbolism and perceived homogeneity of the well manicured lawn, and the use of managed horticulture as
          public and private status symbols and boundaries. <br />
      
          Join us on February 23rd for an epic hop, skip and jump across Swansea.

        <h3>2.30pm Barletta, Apulia, Italy: "The Scenes of Crimini" Among the Perimeters of the Ancient Walls of Barletta </h3>
          
          
        <p class="text">
          After organizing, a few years ago, a temporary installation made of metal nets and enveloped and classified waste called "The crime scene" in Cassano Murge. The "garden of scraps" was an operation accomplished by collecting elements and garbage of all kinds and shown to the public in one of the most important squares for a few weeks. <br />

         During the Festival of Psychogeography 2018, our journey took place in the direction of Porta Marina and then we crossed the Walls of Carmine and stopped at the Paraticchio, there we laid a chaplet of symbolic laurels to practice our ritual dedicated to Terminalia. Then we went along the borders that are no longer there ... the probable track of the beaten sixteenth-century city walls. In Piazza Castello, we placed another small laurel wreath at the foot of the monument to the missing in the sea <br />
         This year for the Festival we propose a singular "walk" between the perimeter that contains very particular "boundaries" of the ancient center in the city of Barletta: "The Scenes of Crimini" Among the Perimeters of the Ancient Walls of Barletta <br />
         The crime scene proposed here is a sort of identification of very singular places within the medieval walls where they were carried out in remote times acts of brutal violence: murders, murderers etc.  We can imagine how many episodes may have occurred in ancient times in the square in front of the castle, along the walls of the Carmine, between the streets of the village! Returning through these tales and symbolic geolocalizations these particular boundaries, Pursing of the "titles" or symbolic stick stickers on the walls of the palaces, between the streets of the medieval nucleus is an operation that symbolically re-enacts buried episodes and forgotten tames ... ..In the so-called seaside village among the humble houses or the ancient palaces of civilians, between churches and buildings inhabited by monks / nuns. In the building next to the church of Sant 'Andrea, turned into a prison how many violences were consumed?  <br />In this way, we will perform a performance in which we will reactivate one of these criminal incidents, now forgotten, which took place in Barletta.
         <br />
         The episodes we will mention are:   <br />
         1) The massacre of the Terlizzesi occurred on 10 January 1899 near the disappearance "Porta Nuova", where the two brothers Baldassare da Terlizzi lost their lives  <br />
         2) Aggression to the Evangelical Community in March 1866 that cost the lives of 4 people, of which only one of evangelical faith occurred near Via del Pesce.
        </p>
        <p class="text-faded">
          Schedule <br />

        <h3>3pm Utrecht, the Netherlands: The Lazy End</h3>

        <p class="text">
          The ancient Terminalia festival is particularly meaningful for the city of Utrecht, where ancient Romans once built
          a military fort on what is now the Domplein, marking the northernmost border of their vast empire.<br />
          Starting at that very real Terminus (a God represented by a temporal or spatial boundary marker), this open participative walk will
          take us southwards to one of the city's storied streets - the Gansstraat. This street, bordered by a prison on one
          end and a cemetery on the other, is popularly known by its nickname <i>The Lazy End</i>, where <i></i>"on one side they sit
          [captive], and on the other they lie."</i> While walking down to The Lazy End, we will playfully explore Utrecht's many
          identities as a 'center' or 'boundary' and dwell on the notion of ending in life and times. <br />
          Depending on weather conditions, we may indulge in a brief lie-in at the cemetery before the group returns to the
          city center for Terminalia Bacchanalia in a bar near het <i>Ledig Erf</i>.
        </p>
        <p class="text-faded">
          This walk is organized by Ienke Kastelein and Witold van Ratingen.
          <br />
          Starting point: by the passage underneath the Domkerk. 15.00. <br />

         <h3>4pm Leeds: Beating the Bounds - Circular walk around medieval boundary of Leeds</h3>
        
          <p class="text">
            Leeds - Beating the Bounds. Bring treats to share, flowers to leave and drinks to keep you warm! With events, interventions, and special performances from local artists. <br />
            We will be walking in an anti-clockwise direction around the city, visiting the ancient boundary stone markers that defined the medieval boundaries of the city. Traditionally, feasting and sacrifices were performed during Terminalia at boundary markers, and we will do the same with things like poetry, cake, flowers or a drink! The boundary markers around Leeds are called bars (gates, possibly that barred off an entrance) and mark the borders where the city ended and the countryside began. Most are recorded and some still exist. <br />
            This year as we will be walking during the day we will be able to see the Burley Bar Stone which is inside a bank! <br />
  
          </p>
      
          <h4>Beating the Bounds: Additional Interventions and Performances</h4>

          <p class="text-faded">
            * <b>'Out of It! Post-urban Desire Lines'</b>. Edgeogs (Simon Bradley & Ursula Troche) will perform untidled voyages from the inner reaches to the outer reaches.</p>

          <br /> <br />
          <b>1.</b> Meet at the <a href="http://upperlockcafe.co.uk/">Upper Lockkeeper’s Café</a> at 10am when
          <b>Jon Seagrave</b> will explain how the shadowy operatives of Stroud & District Psychogeography and Deep
          Topography Commission
          are attempting a 'subjective remapping' of the town, asking for YOUR assistance in locating the unseen
          energies that
          shape and guide our everyday actions here in the bosom of the Five Valleys. Where did YOU have your first
          kiss? Where
          do YOU go when you want tranquillity, or fancy a fist-fight? Help identify Aggression Hotpots, Enlightenment
          Nodes and
          Knee-Trembler Clusters! Ritual Pilgrimages and Fertility Dances may result!
          <br /> <br />

          <b>2.</b>
          <b>Robin Treefellow</b> will take us on a guided walk to Woodchester Roman Villa where we will slip through
          all manner of
          wormholes of Time.
          <br /> <br />
          <b>3.</b> We will then walk up Water Lane to the long barrow at Selsley where
          <b>Stuart Butler</b> will take us on a brief history of swearing: the boundaries between the sacred and the
          profane; the
          elemental and excremental; the physical and the psychical; by Janus and ...
          <br /> Robin Treefellow will also talk of the two names of this barrow: The Toots and the Blacklow – it was
          the site of the
          old Saxon hundred moot called Blacklow Hundred. Folk still like to gather there!
          <br /> We will finish with a toast to Faunus.

        <p class="text">
          In honour of Terminalia, Ruth and you will be walking around the walls of Colchester town in Essex - the
          oldest and longest town wall still surviving in Britain today, 'beating the bounds' and taking in the
          breathtaking views of the town and its environs. Colchester prides itself on being the oldest recorded town
          in Britain. The Roman wall is home to some of the <a href="http://www.romanwall.org/?page_id=347">rarest
            mosses and lichens</a> and if you look really hard you may even find one of the remaining ammonite fossils
          in the wall. Odd finds such as the slice of wall sitting beside pizza place all add to the curiosity of this
          ancient structure.

          The town map is very clear to this day, and various historical sources
          <a class="" href="http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-433-1/dissemination/jpg/coremaps/Aberystwyth_2.jpg">confirm

          Alfred Place, Crynfryn
          Row, Marine Terrace, King Street, Y Ro Fawr, Castle Point
          <br />While the walls are no longer visible, their route is easy to trace. There were gates at Heol Y Bont,
          Great Darkgate Street, Eastgate and Pier Street, which will be noted as
          <a class="light" href="http://www.rogerdboyle.eu/Terminalia/Aberystwyth_2_w.jpg">part of the tour</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="text-faded">
          Meet at 1pm, Castle Point (at the sea wall). The tour takes less than 30 minutes.

        <h3> 5.30pm, Leeds. Beating the Bounds Walk - Circular walk around our boundary of Leeds</h3>

        <p class="text">5.30pm Route planning, dowsing and map browsing for a strict 6pm departure from the bar at <a
            href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/204237011">Wharf Chambers Co-op Club</a> . 2 hrs (easy). Bring
          treats to share, flowers to leave and alcoholic or soft drinks to keep you warm! With events, interventions,
          and special performances from local artists. Led by Tim Waters
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          A slightly different format to past years, we will find, in addition to the medieval stones, our own boundary
          markers of the city. Using crystal dowsing techniques over maps in the bar beforehand participants will plot
          out a route to follow within the city centre. Walkers will then head out to explore the divined places and
          examine whats there and uncover boundary indicators. Once done (or after a set amount of time), examining our
          new boundary markers and the map, we will head inwards to find the centre. At each newly found marker, we
          shall celebrate the boundary with snacks, drinks and flowers, do please bring some to share!
        </p>

        <p class="text-faded">
          We're happy to report that 2018 finds all the medieval boundary markers of Leeds, the bars, marked with blue
          plaques and/or uncovered. Our actions over the years has been successful! This year we will seek in addition
          to explore the city by finding new boundary places. The medieval boundary stones marked out the limits of the
          medieval city, and the entrances and toll booths for animals and trade. Terminus is also the god of non
          physical boundaries such as time and seasons and relationships. How has the city changed from ancient times -
          can we ask our unconcious minds where these new marks would or should be?
        </p>



        <h4>Beating the Bounds: Additional Interventions and Performances</h4>

        <p class="text-faded">
          <a href="http://hud.academia.edu/SimonBradley">Simon Bradley</a> will perform a guided tour of his "Pocket
          Museum of Displacements" at a location along the walk.
        </p>

        <p class="text-faded">
          <a href="https://twitter.com/anzrboo">Anzir Boodoo</a> will perform a traditional Roman blessing at a
          suitable spot along the walk - possibly including an invocation to a Roman river god.
        </p>

        <p class="text-faded">
          Meet 5.30pm at <a href="http://www.wharfchambers.org/">Wharf Chambers</a> bar to be part of the essential
          dowsing, divination and route planning activity. We will leave the bar at 6pm sharp.<br />

        <h3> 6.30pm, Statford, London, Tapping Into The City: Group Walk - Stratford </h3>


        <p class="text">
          Tapping Into The City looks at our movements through private-public space in the city, the impact of urban
          surroundings on us and our relations with each other.
          <br />
          Come and join in this live art piece - a group walk around Stratford - one of London's most overtly
          regenerated areas and centres of privatised-public space (Westfield Stratford City, Queen Elizabeth Olympic
          Park and East Village are all within walking distance).
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Friday 23rd February, 6.30pm. Meeting point - at the bottom of the Meridian Steps (the stairs leading up to
          Westfield, next to the bus and underground station and opposite Stratford Centre).
          <br />
          Nathania will explain the piece and then we'll walk together for an hour or so, simply moving as one through
          the city space, listening to its sound and the sound of our feet. Afterwards we can retreat to a warm pub
          nearby. Ideally we'll wear shoes with pennies stuck to the soles.
        </p>
        <p class="text-faded">
          All welcome! Free, but please book on Eventbrite to secure your space - <a class=" " href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/terminalia-festival-tapping-into-the-city-group-walk-stratford-tickets-42866867956">Tapping

        <h3>6.30. Dalston, London: #DiviningDalston - Wonder Wander around Ridley Road and Dalston</h3>


        <p class="text">
          It's Terminalia Festival of Psychogeography, so after years of informally exploring and documenting Dalston,
          Hackney Tours
          is pairing up with cult Ridley Road gallery space Doomed to host another Hackney Tours Wonder Wander in this
          fascinating
          and culturally rich area.
          <br />
          Hackney Tours has been combing the borough since 2009 and recording the results (see here for examples) while
          Doomed
          have been running deliberately non-commericial shows with a strong photography element and hosting
          alternative free education
          sessions by arts academics.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Join some interesting fellow travellers to stimulate your grey matter. Tour guides, photographers,
          philosophers, thinkers...
          <br />
          Dust off your Debord and let's take our very own Dérive (Drift) – making our own fun as we explore the
          backstreets and
          create our own psychogeographical work.
          <br />
          Don't be intimidated by any of the big French words, it's really just about being open and receptive to
          what's around
          you and taking a moment to stop and smell the flowers. That's what I call a 'wonder wander'. Your opinion and
          thoughts
          about what you see and experience are what's important, not what a textbook says.
          <br />
          We might make some amateur maps, take some photos, or create a narrative. It's not rocket science - but it is
          fun!
          <br />
          WE WILL, OF COURSE, FINISH IN A PUB OR ENVIRONMENT CONDUSIVE TO HYDRATED DEBATE....

                Women Who Walk Network members, friends and curious passersby are invited to take a dérive to celebrate the festival of Terminalia.
                In a tribute to the borderless and liminal, this synchronised walk links to the wider Terminalia Festival. Dérive as you
                like it – try one of these provocations or just follow your curiosity: 1. Walk with friends, family or colleagues. Seek
                synchronicity. Discuss your findings. 2. Disobey signage. Defy walls and boundaries. Walk in a straight line as far as
                you can. 3. Incorporate a catapult. Flip a coin at junctions. Follow your nose, or a noise, or an annoyance.
                <br /> Then share your experiences with fellow celebrants: For instant sharing, tweet while you walk. Upload thoughts, findings
                or images to
                <a href="https://twitter.com/womenwhowalknet">@womenwhowalknet</a> so Sonia can retweet them. Use

                Prepare for the Beating the Bounds walk by exploring the spatial and temporal limits of a lunchtime at Kirkgate Market, Leeds.
                <br /> Meet at 12.40 by the M&S clock, in the 1904 hall for a crowd-sourced tour of the largest covered market in Europe. Following
                our noses for around 25 mins we'll create a spontaneous platter map of vernacular gastronomy and then sit down to destroy
                it with our teeth and taste buds.

                years. The tour explores peoples’ connections to the market and to each other, and shows why markets are an important part
                of our social history. The walk reimagines the market through Hayley's personal stories and experiences, and invites the
                participants to share some of their own along the way. To do this she has
                <a href="img/ball_thread.jpg">a ball of thread</a>, which she will unravel as we walk, and tie knots in to remember each story as it unfolds.

                David Bollinger will spark off the Beating the Bounds walk with a short ritual sacrifice to the other Goddess of Psychogeography:
                Vesta. Vesta (or Hestia as the Greeks called her) is the goddess of liminal spaces, thresholds and hearths. Her place was
                the fireplace, the central hearth in every home. As another boundary entity she was responsible for the centre and thresholds,
                the boundary between spaces (Hermes is the god of travelling across boundaries and you know about Terminus). Sacrifices
                to this domestic, very early primitive goddess was often seen as being done for no reward, literally "going up in smoke."

                We will be walking widdershins (anti-clockwise) around the city, visiting the ancient boundary markers that defined the medieval
                boundaries of the city. Traditionally, feasting and dances were performed during Terminalia at boundary markers, and we
                will do the same with things with cake, flowers and a drink! The boundary markers around Leeds are called bars (gates,
                possibly that barred off an entrance) and mark the borders where the city ended and the countryside began. Some stone markers
                still exist.</p>

              <p class="text">
                Tapping Into The City looks at our movements through private-public space in the city, the impact of urban surroundings on
                us and our relations with each other.
                <br /> Come and join in this live art piece/group walk through the city, starting at Regent's Place. Nathania will explain the
                piece and then we'll walk together for an hour or so. Afterwards we can retreat to a warm pub nearby. No need for expertise, to practice or to perform - we will simply explore and respond to our surroundings and each other by moving as one through the city space and listening to its sound and the sound of our feet. Ideally we'll wear shoes with pennies stuck to the  soles.

                    <p>
                        Sound artist Phill Harding will lead a silent walk of rapid passage and high velocity through central Leeds following a dynamic algorithmically derived route.

                        <h4>* Leeds - Beating the Bounds 6pm eeting in The North Bar Pub, North Street, then around the city. Free. </h4>

                        Leeds - Beating the Bounds - Circular walk around medieval boundary of Leeds. Bring treats to share, flowers to leave and drinks to keep you warm! With events, interventions, and special performances from local artists. More details coming soon. We will be walking in an clockwise direction around the city, visiting the ancient boundary stone markers that defined the medieval boundaries of the city. Traditionally, feasting and sacrifices were performed during Terminalia at boundary
                        markers, and we will do the same with things like poetry, cake, flowers or a drink! The boundary markers around Leeds are called bars (gates, possibly that barred off an entrance) and mark the borders where the city ended and the countryside began. Most are recorded and some still exist.

                        <h5> Simon Bradley: Displacement Activity</h5>
                        A special Displacement Activities intervention involving the group participating in a sonic boundary ritual will occur at some undisclosed part of the walk.

                        <h5> Performances</h5>
                        Anzir Boodoo will perform a traditional Roman blessing at the city's transport termini. The walk may also visit the new glittering southern entrance to the railway station where an invocation to a Roman river god will be enacted as we stand over the water.

                        <h5>Mapping the intangible.</h5>
                        This year our walk will include the opportunity to contribute to a new map of the city which will endeavor to contain some of our thoughts, feelings, memories and insights about the experience of Leeds. Liz Cable, Senior Lecturer in Digital Narratives at Leeds Trinity University will collate and curate your responses to the prompts of the city, and your experience of the Festival: photographs, doodles, memories, prose, poetry, sounds, commentary. What memories do we leave behind as as we walk into the new year. What wishes do we have for this city? Our collection will be mapped onto the city using augmented reality and available for download and re-experience as a mobile app.

                      CELEBRATE TERMINALIA - the festival of Terminus - Roman god of boundaries on Saturday 23rd February, 2pm Leeds.

  We will be walking in a clockwise direction around the city, visiting the ancient boundary markers that defined the medieval boundaries of the city. Traditionally, feasting and sacrifices were performed during Terminalia at boundary markers, and we will do the same with things like poetry, cake, flowers or a drink! The boundary markers around Leeds are called bars (gates, possibly that barred off an entrance) and mark the borders where the city ended and the countryside began. Most are recorded and some still exist. In addition to the historical boundaries that we encounter, you are invited to discover the hidden and not so hidden boundaries and borders that are concrete, social, political or virtual in the city.

  Meet at 2:00 for a 2:15 departure at the North Bar bar (24 New Briggate) then clockwise to the East Bar by the Parish Church, then onto the South Bar, (Adelphi comfort stop) then to the West Bar, near City Square and onto the Burley Bar (Woodhouse Lane, and should be viewable this year!) and completing the circle back at the North Bar for further festivities.
