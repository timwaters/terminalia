        <h3>10am, Stroud. Radical Stroud: Terminalia Festival Walk </h3>


        <p class="text">
          The folks at <a href="http://www.radicalstroud.co.uk">Radical Stroud</a> have a walk planned for Stroud
          involving three very different interactions with boundaries and
          landmarks: spatial, temporal and linguistic.
          <br /> <br />
          <b>1.</b> Meet at the <a href="http://upperlockcafe.co.uk/">Upper Lockkeeper’s Café</a> at 10am when
          <b>Jon Seagrave</b> will explain how the shadowy operatives of Stroud & District Psychogeography and Deep
          Topography Commission
          are attempting a 'subjective remapping' of the town, asking for YOUR assistance in locating the unseen
          energies that
          shape and guide our everyday actions here in the bosom of the Five Valleys. Where did YOU have your first
          kiss? Where
          do YOU go when you want tranquillity, or fancy a fist-fight? Help identify Aggression Hotpots, Enlightenment
          Nodes and
          Knee-Trembler Clusters! Ritual Pilgrimages and Fertility Dances may result!
          <br /> <br />

          <b>2.</b>
          <b>Robin Treefellow</b> will take us on a guided walk to Woodchester Roman Villa where we will slip through
          all manner of
          wormholes of Time.
          <br /> <br />
          <b>3.</b> We will then walk up Water Lane to the long barrow at Selsley where
          <b>Stuart Butler</b> will take us on a brief history of swearing: the boundaries between the sacred and the
          profane; the
          elemental and excremental; the physical and the psychical; by Janus and ...
          <br /> Robin Treefellow will also talk of the two names of this barrow: The Toots and the Blacklow – it was
          the site of the
          old Saxon hundred moot called Blacklow Hundred. Folk still like to gather there!
          <br /> We will finish with a toast to Faunus.
        </p>
        <p class="text-faded">

          Please bring food and drink to share....And so to home. <br />

          Walking with The Waste Land and their
          friends will be conducting a walk from

          On this walk we will walk to "Mick’s
          post" from here we will experiment with
          some low tide mud walking, using knots
          in ropes to record the experience. <br />
          We will then return to Mick’s post where
          where we will tie the knotted ropes to
          Mick’s post in a symbolic ritual of the celebration of Terminus.

        <p class="text-faded">
          Mick’s post is a white post in Seasalter which has been erected near the sea wall to indicate the
          boundary for the digging of bait in the estuary. <br />

        <h3>12pm. Colchester. Ruth Raymer: Beating the Bounds Around the Walls of Colchester Town </h3>


        <p class="text">
          In honour of Terminalia, Ruth and you will be walking around the walls of Colchester town in Essex - the
          oldest and longest town wall still surviving in Britain today, 'beating the bounds' and taking in the
          breathtaking views of the town and its environs. Colchester prides itself on being the oldest recorded town
          in Britain. The Roman wall is home to some of the <a href="http://www.romanwall.org/?page_id=347">rarest
            mosses and lichens</a> and if you look really hard you may even find one of the remaining ammonite fossils
          in the wall. Odd finds such as the slice of wall sitting beside pizza place all add to the curiosity of this
          ancient structure.
        </p>
        <p class="text-faded">
          We will depart from the Firstsite Gallery Cafe at noon on Friday 23rd Feb - find address and map here: <a

        <h3> 5.30pm, Leeds. Beating the Bounds Walk - Circular walk around our boundary of Leeds</h3>

        <p class="text">5.30pm Route planning, dowsing and map browsing for a strict 6pm departure from the bar at <a
            href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/204237011">Wharf Chambers Co-op Club</a> . 2 hrs (easy). Bring
          treats to share, flowers to leave and alcoholic or soft drinks to keep you warm! With events, interventions,
          and special performances from local artists. Led by Tim Waters
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          A slightly different format to past years, we will find, in addition to the medieval stones, our own boundary
          markers of the city. Using crystal dowsing techniques over maps in the bar beforehand participants will plot
          out a route to follow within the city centre. Walkers will then head out to explore the divined places and
          examine whats there and uncover boundary indicators. Once done (or after a set amount of time), examining our
          new boundary markers and the map, we will head inwards to find the centre. At each newly found marker, we
          shall celebrate the boundary with snacks, drinks and flowers, do please bring some to share!
        </p>

        <p class="text-faded">
          We're happy to report that 2018 finds all the medieval boundary markers of Leeds, the bars, marked with blue
          plaques and/or uncovered. Our actions over the years has been successful! This year we will seek in addition
          to explore the city by finding new boundary places. The medieval boundary stones marked out the limits of the
          medieval city, and the entrances and toll booths for animals and trade. Terminus is also the god of non
          physical boundaries such as time and seasons and relationships. How has the city changed from ancient times -
          can we ask our unconcious minds where these new marks would or should be?
        </p>



        <h4>Beating the Bounds: Additional Interventions and Performances</h4>

        <p class="text-faded">
          <a href="http://hud.academia.edu/SimonBradley">Simon Bradley</a> will perform a guided tour of his "Pocket
          Museum of Displacements" at a location along the walk.
        </p>

        <p class="text-faded">
          <a href="https://twitter.com/anzrboo">Anzir Boodoo</a> will perform a traditional Roman blessing at a
          suitable spot along the walk - possibly including an invocation to a Roman river god.
        </p>

        <p class="text-faded">
          Meet 5.30pm at <a href="http://www.wharfchambers.org/">Wharf Chambers</a> bar to be part of the essential
          dowsing, divination and route planning activity. We will leave the bar at 6pm sharp.<br />
          Event is free, just turn up. Tickets would be nice, they are not required but help us plan numbers.

        <h3> 6.30pm, Statford, London, Tapping Into The City: Group Walk - Stratford </h3>


        <p class="text">
          Tapping Into The City looks at our movements through private-public space in the city, the impact of urban
          surroundings on us and our relations with each other.
          <br />
          Come and join in this live art piece - a group walk around Stratford - one of London's most overtly
          regenerated areas and centres of privatised-public space (Westfield Stratford City, Queen Elizabeth Olympic
          Park and East Village are all within walking distance).
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Friday 23rd February, 6.30pm. Meeting point - at the bottom of the Meridian Steps (the stairs leading up to
          Westfield, next to the bus and underground station and opposite Stratford Centre).
          <br />
          Nathania will explain the piece and then we'll walk together for an hour or so, simply moving as one through
          the city space, listening to its sound and the sound of our feet. Afterwards we can retreat to a warm pub
          nearby. Ideally we'll wear shoes with pennies stuck to the soles.
        </p>
        <p class="text-faded">
          All welcome! Free, but please book on Eventbrite to secure your space - <a class=" " href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/terminalia-festival-tapping-into-the-city-group-walk-stratford-tickets-42866867956">Tapping

        <h3>6.30. Dalston, London: #DiviningDalston - Wonder Wander around Ridley Road and Dalston</h3>


        <p class="text">
          It's Terminalia Festival of Psychogeography, so after years of informally exploring and documenting Dalston,
          Hackney Tours
          is pairing up with cult Ridley Road gallery space Doomed to host another Hackney Tours Wonder Wander in this
          fascinating
          and culturally rich area.
          <br />
          Hackney Tours has been combing the borough since 2009 and recording the results (see here for examples) while
          Doomed
          have been running deliberately non-commericial shows with a strong photography element and hosting
          alternative free education
          sessions by arts academics.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Join some interesting fellow travellers to stimulate your grey matter. Tour guides, photographers,
          philosophers, thinkers...
          <br />
          Dust off your Debord and let's take our very own Dérive (Drift) – making our own fun as we explore the
          backstreets and
          create our own psychogeographical work.
          <br />
          Don't be intimidated by any of the big French words, it's really just about being open and receptive to
          what's around
          you and taking a moment to stop and smell the flowers. That's what I call a 'wonder wander'. Your opinion and
          thoughts
          about what you see and experience are what's important, not what a textbook says.
          <br />
          We might make some amateur maps, take some photos, or create a narrative. It's not rocket science - but it is
          fun!
          <br />
          WE WILL, OF COURSE, FINISH IN A PUB OR ENVIRONMENT CONDUSIVE TO HYDRATED DEBATE....

                Women Who Walk Network members, friends and curious passersby are invited to take a dérive to celebrate the festival of Terminalia.
                In a tribute to the borderless and liminal, this synchronised walk links to the wider Terminalia Festival. Dérive as you
                like it – try one of these provocations or just follow your curiosity: 1. Walk with friends, family or colleagues. Seek
                synchronicity. Discuss your findings. 2. Disobey signage. Defy walls and boundaries. Walk in a straight line as far as
                you can. 3. Incorporate a catapult. Flip a coin at junctions. Follow your nose, or a noise, or an annoyance.
                <br /> Then share your experiences with fellow celebrants: For instant sharing, tweet while you walk. Upload thoughts, findings
                or images to
                <a href="https://twitter.com/womenwhowalknet">@womenwhowalknet</a> so Sonia can retweet them. Use

                Prepare for the Beating the Bounds walk by exploring the spatial and temporal limits of a lunchtime at Kirkgate Market, Leeds.
                <br /> Meet at 12.40 by the M&S clock, in the 1904 hall for a crowd-sourced tour of the largest covered market in Europe. Following
                our noses for around 25 mins we'll create a spontaneous platter map of vernacular gastronomy and then sit down to destroy
                it with our teeth and taste buds.

                years. The tour explores peoples’ connections to the market and to each other, and shows why markets are an important part
                of our social history. The walk reimagines the market through Hayley's personal stories and experiences, and invites the
                participants to share some of their own along the way. To do this she has
                <a href="img/ball_thread.jpg">a ball of thread</a>, which she will unravel as we walk, and tie knots in to remember each story as it unfolds.

                David Bollinger will spark off the Beating the Bounds walk with a short ritual sacrifice to the other Goddess of Psychogeography:
                Vesta. Vesta (or Hestia as the Greeks called her) is the goddess of liminal spaces, thresholds and hearths. Her place was
                the fireplace, the central hearth in every home. As another boundary entity she was responsible for the centre and thresholds,
                the boundary between spaces (Hermes is the god of travelling across boundaries and you know about Terminus). Sacrifices
                to this domestic, very early primitive goddess was often seen as being done for no reward, literally "going up in smoke."

                We will be walking widdershins (anti-clockwise) around the city, visiting the ancient boundary markers that defined the medieval
                boundaries of the city. Traditionally, feasting and dances were performed during Terminalia at boundary markers, and we
                will do the same with things with cake, flowers and a drink! The boundary markers around Leeds are called bars (gates,
                possibly that barred off an entrance) and mark the borders where the city ended and the countryside began. Some stone markers
                still exist.</p>

              <h3>6.30pm, London, Tapping Into The City: Group Walk - Regent's Place</h3>
              <p class="text">
                Tapping Into The City looks at our movements through private-public space in the city, the impact of urban surroundings on
                us and our relations with each other.
                <br /> Come and join in this live art piece/group walk through the city, starting at Regent's Place. Nathania will explain the
                piece and then we'll walk together for an hour or so. Afterwards we can retreat to a warm pub nearby. No need for expertise, to practice or to perform - we will simply explore and respond to our surroundings and each other by moving as one through the city space and listening to its sound and the sound of our feet. Ideally we'll wear shoes with pennies stuck to the  soles.
              </p>

                        <h4>* Leeds - Beating the Bounds 6pm eeting in The North Bar Pub, North Street, then around the city. Free. </h4>

                        Leeds - Beating the Bounds - Circular walk around medieval boundary of Leeds. Bring treats to share, flowers to leave and drinks to keep you warm! With events, interventions, and special performances from local artists. More details coming soon. We will be walking in an clockwise direction around the city, visiting the ancient boundary stone markers that defined the medieval boundaries of the city. Traditionally, feasting and sacrifices were performed during Terminalia at boundary
                        markers, and we will do the same with things like poetry, cake, flowers or a drink! The boundary markers around Leeds are called bars (gates, possibly that barred off an entrance) and mark the borders where the city ended and the countryside began. Most are recorded and some still exist.

                        <h5> Simon Bradley: Displacement Activity</h5>
                        A special Displacement Activities intervention involving the group participating in a sonic boundary ritual will occur at some undisclosed part of the walk.

                        <h5> Performances</h5>
                        Anzir Boodoo will perform a traditional Roman blessing at the city's transport termini. The walk may also visit the new glittering southern entrance to the railway station where an invocation to a Roman river god will be enacted as we stand over the water.

                        <h5>Mapping the intangible.</h5>
                        This year our walk will include the opportunity to contribute to a new map of the city which will endeavor to contain some of our thoughts, feelings, memories and insights about the experience of Leeds. Liz Cable, Senior Lecturer in Digital Narratives at Leeds Trinity University will collate and curate your responses to the prompts of the city, and your experience of the Festival: photographs, doodles, memories, prose, poetry, sounds, commentary. What memories do we leave behind as as we walk into the new year. What wishes do we have for this city? Our collection will be mapped onto the city using augmented reality and available for download and re-experience as a mobile app.

                      <p>
                      We will be walking in a clockwise direction around the city, visiting the ancient boundary markers that defined the medieval boundaries of the city. Traditionally, feasting and sacrifices were performed during Terminalia at boundary markers, and we will do the same with things like poetry, cake, flowers or a drink! The boundary markers around Leeds are called bars (gates, possibly that barred off an entrance) and mark the borders where the city ended and the countryside began. Most are recorded and some still exist.

                      Meet at 4:00 for a 4:15 departure at the North Bar bar (24 New Briggate) then clockwise to the East Bar by the Parish Church, then onto the South Bar, (Adelphi comfort stop) then to the West Bar, near City Square and onto the Burley Bar (Woodhouse Lane) and completing the circle back at the North Bar for further festivities.

                      CELEBRATE TERMINALIA - the festival of Terminus - Roman god of boundaries on Saturday 23rd February, 2pm Leeds.

  We will be walking in a clockwise direction around the city, visiting the ancient boundary markers that defined the medieval boundaries of the city. Traditionally, feasting and sacrifices were performed during Terminalia at boundary markers, and we will do the same with things like poetry, cake, flowers or a drink! The boundary markers around Leeds are called bars (gates, possibly that barred off an entrance) and mark the borders where the city ended and the countryside began. Most are recorded and some still exist. In addition to the historical boundaries that we encounter, you are invited to discover the hidden and not so hidden boundaries and borders that are concrete, social, political or virtual in the city.

  Meet at 2:00 for a 2:15 departure at the North Bar bar (24 New Briggate) then clockwise to the East Bar by the Parish Church, then onto the South Bar, (Adelphi comfort stop) then to the West Bar, near City Square and onto the Burley Bar (Woodhouse Lane, and should be viewable this year!) and completing the circle back at the North Bar for further festivities.
