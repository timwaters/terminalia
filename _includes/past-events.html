      <h3>Thurs 23 Feb. Shoreditch UK: Elspeth Penfold: A Walk On the Edge with The Glass Onion</h3>
      <div class="documentation">
        <div class="doc">documentation</div>
        Billie gave us a fascinating talk about the meaning & history of Quechua & an invitation "to observe the edges of the contradictory nature of the world that we presently live in". We walked through 7 radial points. Terminalia - a day for observing boundaries & thresholds. <br />
        <img src="img/past/2023/onion1.jpg" height="400px">  <img src="img/past/2023/onion2.jpg" height="400px">  <img src="img/past/2023/onion3.jpg" height="400px"> 
      </div>
    
      <p class="text">
        I invite you to join me with Thread and Word.
        We will walk alone or together and take a
        view of our walking experience through a
        glass onion. You might of course prefer rose
        tinted spectacles .
        <br />
        <a href="img/past/2023/image0.jpeg"><img src="img/past/2023/image0_400px.jpeg" height="400px"></a>
        <br />
        The plan is to look for associations that might
        be hidden humorous, inspire hope or defy
        rhyme or reason. This is an invitation to
        observe, through the glass onion, the edges
        of the contradictory nature of the world that
        we presently live in .

        <br /><br />
        To be honest, onions take me to the edge. I
        think that the onion is very compatible with
        Terminalia, as a boundary to how you feel
        physically once ingested. The glass onion
        might give us a tool to explore things a little
        differently.
        <br /><br />

        You might like to carry an onion and peel it
        as you progress or you might prefer to look
        through the bottom of a glass bottle.
        <br /><br />
      
        As always feel free to interpret this invitation
        as you wish. Feel free to wander and see
        where this takes you. <br />
        I will be sharing our experience on  the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThreadandWord">Thread and Word Facebook</a> page and will be delighted to
        include yours if you are happy to share.
      </p>

      <p class="text-faded">
        I will be walking in Shoreditch.

      <h3>Thurs 23 Feb. 10am. Osaka. Japan: Widdershins Osaka! 2023 </h3>
    
      <div class="documentation">
        <div class="doc">documentation</div>
        <a href="img/past/2023/widdershins_osaka.pdf">Gareth writes:</a> Both Chika Ueda, who has participated in each of the five previous walks, and Jerry Gordon whose novel Terminalian Drift spins a story out of his encounters on Widdershins Osaka! 2018 helped shape the walk’s structure and co-conjure its interventions and micro-performances 
        <br />
        <img src="img/past/2023/osaka1.png" height="400px"> 
        <br />
        At the outset, a long painted stick or cane (a variation on one of Jerry’s signature props) with a cluster of little
        cubes tied to one end was handed to a participant who was asked to walk in any direction they chose.
        The rest of the group was instructed to follow. The stick-bearer rolled a set of dice to determine how
        many minutes they would lead the group in this way. When the time was up the group stopped and the
        stick-bearer was asked to choose a box from the cluster and open it. Inside was a quote, some instructions
        and objects such as acorns, a toy, or paper flowers. Together these items asked the walker to give
        thought to their engagement with the city, perhaps through listening for incongruous sounds, or seeking
        out hidden fissures in the fabric of the city where flowers might secretly flourish, or identifying micro-
        landscapes embedded within the wider terrain. Once satisfied, the bearer then handed the stick to
        another in the group who would shake the dice and set off, again in any direction they chose, and again
        with the group in tow. <br />

        After a hiatus of a year or two
        the Terminalian Widdershins Organising Committee
        (TWOC) has recently convened to confirm that this
        year they will drift again. And we are all invited. But
        who and what is TWOC? TWOC are archaeologists
        of the near-future. On their knees, hunched over
        unstable terrain and fuelled by nothing more than
        black coffee and good cheesecake, they
        painstakingly remove the sediments of yesterday to
        reveal the lost image of tomorrow. 

        
        Details of this
        year’s gathering are still unclear but so far this much
        is known: on the morning of Thursday, February 23rd
        TWOC will assemble in central Osaka for a few
        hours of urban meander, encounter and interaction.
        So let's put the date in our diaries and wait for further
        details.

        We have experienced the Festival by re-appropriating urban spaces, making them become stages for rituals of immersive crossings between history and contemporaneity. Revisiting the ancient
        custom of Beating the Bounds which involved a tour around the perimeter of a plot of land and is usually connected to the demarcation of a parish boundary.
        <br /><img src="img/past/2023/bisc_after.jpg" height="400px"><br />
        The first meeting "Walking around the boundaries"
        was dedicated to schools with the participation of
        some students and their teachers, the action of civic
        art symbolically underlined ideal boundaries
        between maritime authorities and civilians who were
        rhythmically beaten (to the sound of a Tibetan bell)
        by students with long cane wands.<br />
        <img src="img/past/2023/bisc_after3.jpg" height="400px"><br />
        In the second meeting a conference was held.
        We discussed the origin of the "Terminalia", we
        reflected on some issues related to the
        concepts of border, delimitation, limits, walls starting
        from the origin of fraternal conflicts like that one
        of Romulus and Remus who ended up tragically for
        having crossed a "limit" as it was
        in use at the time if the "Term" was violated.
       
        
        <br />
        We have reflected on the different views of
        ownership between indigenous Indian peoples and i
        Dutch colonizers of the island of Manhattan who
        build a wall precisely "Wall Street" for separate from
        the natives.
        <br />
        During the last day a completely unique walk took
        place starting from the medieval church of Santa
        Margherita, full of stories and testimonies of stone
        and to follow along the city walls with the reading of
        excerpts and the declination of poems.
        <br />
        <img src="img/past/2023/bisc_after1.jpg" height="400px"><br />
        The rituals of "Beating the Bounds" were repeated in
        two specific boundaries, including the ecclesiastical
        one located along via Trieste at the height of Palazzo
        Ammazzalorsa.
        <br />
        The walk ended at the base of the sailors' monument
        with the deposition of three wreaths laurel as a sign
        of homage to the victims at sea.

      <h3> Thurs 23 Feb. 1pm. Stroud: Radical Stroud, Boundaries & Barrows,  A Walk Exploring the Earthworks of Minchinhampton Common</h3>
    
      <div class="documentation">
        <div class="doc">documentation</div>
        We explored the lumps, bumps, tumps, mounds & barrows of Minchinhampton Common. Libations were made to the god Terminus and also to the local spirits of the common. There was much discussion of such things as the history of rabbits and the nature and pronunciation of the enigmatic "Bulwarks".  <br />

        There are many earthworks on Minchinhampton Common.  A glance at an OS map reveals Mounds, Barrows, Enclosures, Tumps, and the enigmatic banks and ditches of the “Bulwarks”.  
        <br />
        <img src="img/past/2023/stroud_barrow.jpg" height="400px"><br />
        As a contribution to the Terminalia Festival 2023, Radical Stroud will undertake a circular walk to explore and celebrate these features.  We will visit many of the prominent earthworks on the common and consider explanations for their existence. Theories both archaeological and folkloric, old and new, will be discussed and debated.    New ideas are particularly welcome. We may even perform a ritual or two, honour Terminus or other local deities. 
      </p>
      <p class="text-faded">
        Difficulty - The common is a level plateau for the most part. There are fine views of the Stroud valleys. The route will take place over some golf course areas, patches of rough grassland and the banks and ditches of some of the earthworks.  No stiles or fences.  This will be a leisurely walk of about 3.5km/2m. 
        <br />

        There will be an opportunity for refreshments in the pubs of Amberley after the walk. 
        <br />
        
        Start (13.00) from the War Memorial at Amberley & Finish (approximately 15.30) - at the same place.

        ArtCouple (Simon Bradley & Ursula Troche) ventured out into the freezing stillness of Anthorn
      in the hope of detecting the Time Signal from the National Physical Laboratory's transmission site. 
      Time at England's edge.  <br /> <br />
      Mind the Time, watch this space, listen to the sound of time-transmission. <br />
      Three atomic clocks kept us in check as we wandered around the perimeter of the site.  <br />
      Neo-meridiian, post-Greenwich time frame accentuations, fluctuations... and somewhere 
      buried in the layers of noise, the Time Signal itself! Mumble, burble, squelch. <br />
      <br />
      The birds knew all, but weren't telling.

      <h3>Thurs 23 Feb. 7pm Leeds: Cath Otpangei: Terminalia Walk Around the City</h3>
    
      <p class="text">
        As an interdisciplinary practitioner, my practice is deeply rooted in the realm of psychogeography and its intersections with the urban realm. My work engages with the concept of dérive, which is a technique that aims to reveal the unconscious landscape of the city through drifting and exploration. 
        <br /> <br />    
       <img src="img/past/2023/cath.png" height="400px">
        <br />
        For Terminalia 2023, I am proposing an immersive, interactive and site-specific event that navigates the complexities of a designated area within Leeds. Through this event, I aim to unveil the hidden narratives embedded within the urban landscape and to subvert the hegemonic structures that shape our understanding of place.            The event will commence with a contextualization of the designated area, utilizing cartography as a medium to highlight the key landmarks and points of interest. The participatory walk, guided by performative prompts, aims to elicit a multisensory engagement with the site and prompt the audience to question their relationship with the urban environment.             The event concludes with a collective debrief where the audience can reflect on their experience, and engage in a discourse about the psychogeography of the area and its role in shaping our understanding of place.
        <br />
        The walk tour will begin at a pre-specified locaton (details sent to participants before) and will take participants through a range of places from the mundane to the fantastical.

      <h3>Thurs 23 Feb. Solo performance: Patrick Ford: '20 Minute Diameter Leeds' </h3>

      <div class="documentation">
        <div class="doc">documentation</div>
        <a href="http://33temple.blogspot.com/2023/03/20-minute-diameter-leeds-terminalia.html">Patrick writes:</a> 
        As part of 4WCoP 2022 (Fourth World Congress of Psychogeography), Mathilda Guerin created a project entitled 'Walking Webs', inviting people to participate by creating a walking web of their own city and I created my own walking web in Leeds, my home town in the UK.   <br />

        My walking web was created, according to the supplied instructions, by walking from a selected starting point, North, South East and West. Along each of these axes, we were asked to walk for 10 minutes and 20 minutes respectively and to take a photograph at each of these points. It was then possible to connect up all four of the 10 minute points and also the 20 points.  <br />
        
        My walking web, and the photos taken after walking for 10 minutes and 20 minutes can be seen here:  <br />

      On Thursday 23 February 2023 I started walking from the northern point, close to the College of Building on North Street, walking clockwise. <br />

        On Thursday 23rd February, Patrick will walk a roughly circular route around Leeds in West Yorkshire. To mark the festival this year, Patrick will walk the route of a walking web he made in Leeds for a project presented by <a href="https://www.wildlyidle.com/walkingwebs">Mathilda Guerin</a> at the <a href="https://www.4wcop.org/">2022 4th World Congress of Psychogeography</a>. <br />
        <img src="img/past/2023/patrick_ford.png" height="400px"><br />
        Patrick created a map indicating way points representing the location reached after walking 10 & 20 minutes North, South, East and West. For Terminalia 2023, Patrick will walk a clockwise, circular route, linking up all of the 10 minute way points, beginning near to the College of Building on North Street.

      <h3>Fri 24 Feb. 2pm.  Your shopping mall: Nicola Mazzuia - NON-PLACES TOUR (THE MALL) </h3>
    
    
      <p class="text">
       <i> Wandering through a shopping mall as an act of rebellion. </i>
       <br />
       <img src="img/past/2023/non-places.jpg" height="400px">
       <br />
       Everyone will walk around the mall alone, but at the same time, we will share the experience through the Telegram channel. You will be led by a voice that will propose reflections and practical exercises. 
       <br />
       It is going to be a 'psychedelic' journey in the etymological sense: we aim to bring light through the psyche, to break preconfigured patterns in order to see things from a new perspective. 
       <br />
       We are going to deal with a bunch of contradictions through the observation of ourselves in space, triggering reflections on our lives both physical and virtual.
       <br />
       At a particular time such as the one we are living through, the sense of this experience echoes in the words of Eduardo Kohn: 'and it is precisely this upheaval, the breaking of old habits and the reconstruction of new ones, that constitutes our feeling of being alive and in the world. The world reveals itself to us not because we have habits, but in the moments when forced to abandon old habits, we assume new ones'.

      </p>
      <p class="text-faded">
        To participate, you must go to the nearest shopping centre on Friday 24 February at 2 pm. We will all start together in front of the entrance, (or rather in front of the entrances, ideally a different one for each participant).  <br />

        You must have an internet connection on your mobile phone, have the Telegram application installed, and have joined the channel:

      <h3>Sat 25 Feb. 1.30pm. Scotland. Tamsin Grainger & Ewan Dawson: A Terminalia community walk along the Edinburgh / East Lothian border  </h3>
    
      <div class="documentation">
        <div class="doc">documentation</div>
        <a href="https://riverofthings.wordpress.com/2023/03/02/libations/">Ewan writes on his blog River of Things</a>: We go rather uncertainly to celebrate Terminalia, this involves following an invisible line between Edinburgh (Capital City, Athens of the North, Up the Toon, Fur Coat and No Knickers) and East Lothian ( Home of Scotlands Flag, Country Living, Doon the Club and Ah Kent Yer Faither) which seeks edges – a burn mouth, the enclosing boundary wall of a Palladian mansion, a railway line, and then some field boundaries around the back of the village of Newcraighall…
        <br />
        <img src="img/past/2023/libations1.jpg" height="400px"><br />
        Invisible lines are more agile than psychogeographers, so we have had to deviate from the line to walk through some identical housing schemes ( occupied and hopefully vacant) and along freshly paved roads. At the end of these there is a gap in the line of trees and a desire path crosses the wall which hosts our boundary, and leads into the fallow fields and scrub beyond. <br />
        My libation is a pack of pilfered seeds ( ‘Wild Bumblebee Mix’ to be specific and ironic). Just beyond the wall someone has flytipped a pile of garden compost, which seems a nice invitation. <br />

      <p class="text">
        Come with us to celebrate Terminalia (or near enough) as we look for the invisible line that marks the edges of Edinburgh and East Lothian.
        Along the way we'll encounter hermits, skylarks, horses, incinerators, filmmakers and probably some mud (bring suitable footwear and your own libations and feasting materials). <br />
      
        <img src="img/past/2023/tamsin.png" height="400px"><br />
        Starting point - car park of Booker Cash and Carry, on the left between Eastfield and Musselburgh (bus routes 26, 44, and various East Lothian County Buses). 
        End point - either Newcraighall village, Fort Kinnaird shopping centre (both are on the Lothian Regional Transport bus route 30), or Shawfair railway station depending on your stamina and inclination.  <br />
        There is not much in the way of refreshments and loos on route but we will route via Newhailes National Trust for Scotland (which has loos) and a faux pub at Newcraighall (The Cuddie Brae) which will offer a potential alternative terminus for those who have tired of spoil heaps and culverts.<br />
        On the day some thought might be given to using the train for the last part of the route between Newcraighall and Shawfair stations.<br />
        We've designed this as a uni-directional walk but a round-trip can be completed by taking the train back from either of these to Brunstane British Rail and either catching #44 bus or walking to where we started.

      <h3>Sun 26 Feb. 12pm Ghent, Belgium: Witold van Ratingen & Ienke Kastelein:  Ommekeer / Turnaround </h3>
      <div class="documentation">
        <div class="doc">documentation</div>
        <img src="img/past/2023/gent1.jpg" height="400px"><br />
        Witold writes: The starting point of our walk today, at the Sint-Veerleplein
        (Saint Pharaildis' square) – "at the end", as you can read
        there on the facade – is no coincidence. This place is known
        informally in Ghent as the square of death, used in the
        Middle Ages to conduct the most gruesome executions. I
        will spare you the details, but they involved very large
        cooking pots. Today, the square has become a place where the start of new life is celebrated. Each time a child is born
        in a Ghent maternity ward, the lanterns on the square
        sparkle festively.<br />
       
It was Julius Caeasar who later moved the start of the year
to January, where it has since remained. January, named
after Janus, the Roman god of gates, transitions, doors and
passages. In the later Roman Empire, Janus would take an
increasingly important position in the pantheon. Janus was
attributed mastery over time itself: he ruled over history
and future, over the origins of the world and of every human
life.<br />
In daily life, Romans ritually rubbed wolf fat on their
doorways, to keep out evil spirits and invite Janus to bless
their families with new life. We have unfortunately had to conclude that EU regulations these days have rendered wolf
fat a difficult product to obtain. We have considered
substituting wool fat, but ultimately decided to spare you
the sticky fingers. So we will make do with a piece of wool,
allowing you to beseech Janus' blessings when you get
home.<br />
Strange, though, to have two gods. If Janus governs time, he
should oversee all beginnings and endings alike. So why would
we still need Terminus, the god of the border? What silliness to
divide this power between the two. Wouldn't it be much more
elegant to interpret Janus' two faces by deciding that Janus and
Terminus are one and the same, that one refers to beginnings
and the other to conclusions?<br />
<img src="img/past/2023/gent2.jpg" height="400px"><br />
Oh well. If we must have two separate gods, Janus for the
beginning and Terminus for the end, I am afraid that Janus is at
least a little overrated. People love beginnings: newborn babies,
youth, first loves, promising start-ups. Pure desire, pure future,
without all those heavy memories and hard-learned lessons
weighing them down. The lightness of new being isn't
unbearable, it is simply blissful.<br />
Still, each beginning only draws its significance from an ending.
As Heidegger writes, death does not approach us from the
outside; it is part of us, the kind of creatures that we are, and its
shadow impregnates our lives with meaning. Things that have
begun, says Augustine, will always be a source of great anxiety,
until they have been brought to an ending, an ending to which
our minds are ever set with great anticipation. So it is with all
lives, all years, all walks: it is finitude that makes them what they
are.<br />
Spring is coming, and we will not have to wait long for a new beginning. The Romans saw
every New Year's Day as an omen for the rest of the year, and so
they spent it wishing each other good fortune, and exchanging
dates, figs, and honey. May your futures taste sweet.

      <h3>Sun 26 Feb. 2.30pm. Bristol: Sam Jenks / Paul Bradley. Queerscapes Terminalia</h3>
    
      <div class="documentation">
        <div class="doc">documentation</div>
        A small but diverse group of LGBTQ writers walked a kind of semi-dérive, semi due to
        the fact we did have a desired finishing point.<br />
        We were keen to avoid the trap of it becoming a queer history walk and so much of
        our conversation along the way was about how we as LGBTQ+ individuals related to
        the city. Our drift effectively started in Leonard Lane a narrow alleyway with double yellow
        lines! From that point on, attendees took it in turns to choose the direction at each
        junction, though with our end point in mind. <br />
        <img src="img/past/2023/bristol3.jpg" height="400px"><br />

          You will see form the map of our drift, that we followed a large portion of the city wall,
          interestingly without being totally aware of that fact. We thought about this boundary
          and what it might have meant in the past, what it means now for queer people. We
          looked out for the boundary markers set into walls and buildings along this part of the
          route.The group also particularly liked a set of steps built into the wall, a portal
          between inner and outer.<br />

        A walk to bring together LGBTQ+ writers to consider the city, the urban environment and how we write about it. To explore what opportunities it offers us to bring the city alive in our writing. I also want to tease Terminus a bit to be honest, he's all rules and boundaries, but like in Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson books, I reckon Terminus has a soft spot for people who use their quickness of mind to bend around them. We can do that!  The activity is meant to fun, absurd even. And please be gentle with me, I've never done anything like this before!  <br />

        We will meet at the Watershed Cafe, Bristol, from 2.30pm and then at 3pm head off on a pretty random walk through the old city and touching on the old city boundaries and then beyond and on to Old Market.<br />

        Along the way, it's very much up to who is there and the direction we take but these are some of the things I've made a note of and might be doing:<br />
        
        - listening to other walkers stories about how they relate to the city<br />
        - thinking about actual boundaries and how they might have shaped the LGBTQ+ layers of the city. <br />
        - looking out for city boundary stones and markers.<br />
        - talking with others about the queer geography of the city, how I relate to it as a gay man.<br />
        - looking out for lines of desire.<br />
        - refer to the Outstories App of LGBT+ Bristol <br />
        - map my walk on an app I have on my phone<br />
        - makes notes as I go along include photographs, sound recordings, written notes.<br />
        - collect archival material should the opportunity arise.<br />
        - finish up at either Wardrobe Theatre or Old Market Tavern (tbc) for drinks , snacks, where we share our stories, interpretations and responses to the walk.

      <h3>10am Stroud, UK, Radical Stroud: A Circumnavigation of Stroud and investigation of the "Five Valleys" </h3>
    
    
      <p class="text">
        For the 2022 Terminalia walk we will follow the established route of the Way Around Stroud Way (WAS Way).  Please follow <a href="https://www.stroudtown.gov.uk/uploads/was-way-map-web.pdf">https://www.stroudtown.gov.uk/uploads/was-way-map-web.pdf</a> to obtain the excellent and very informative guide to the walk.  This contains a map, trail guide, height profile and concise details of the fascinating history of Stroud and the five valleys.
        <br /> 
        The theme of the festival in 2022 is "Wisdom – the ability to discern what is true, right or lasting".  We will consider this theme with reference to the valleys that surround the town
        <br />  <br />
        The town of Stroud is famed for lying at the junction of five Cotswold valleys.  Indeed, the phrase "the five valleys" is synonymous for Stroud area.  It is perhaps a little surprising that the identity of the five valleys is open to some dispute. A quick look at an OS map will show that many valleys converge in the general vicinity of Stroud.  Which of them are the renowned five?  In search of wisdom on the walk, we will consider the contentious issue of the number and identity of the Stroud Valleys.  We will also seek to understand how the character of Stroud has been created and influenced by the valleys.  There are stories to be told of food riots and mills, geology and streams, canals, railways, sheep and gods.
        <br />  <br />
        The walk also provides an opportunity to explore the legend of the mysterious and elusive sixth valley of Ditchley Yat.  This valley cannot be found on contemporary maps and is reputed to move from place to place, or to appear and disappear from time to time.  Legend maintains that DitchleyYat decided to hide itself to avoid paying the poll tax in 1381, and it has featured in local folklore ever since.  Can there be any truth, or perhaps any wisdom in these tales?

      <p class="text-faded">
        We will start the walk on Wednesday 23rd of February, at 10.00am at Wallbridge (point 1 on the map). Expect to take at least 5 hours and please note the information about the ups, downs and difficulty of the route in the WAS Way guide.  <br />

      <p class="text">
     Patrick Ford will be walking with Dr. Nina Yiu. <br />We will walk from the Old Town of Bridlington in East Yorks, down to the old priory church and bayle gate and then follow the road that links the old town to the harbour, that was the site of the old quay. Originally the old town and the quay were two separate, but related locations whereas now they have been combined into the modern town.

        <img src="img/past/2022/woody.png" height="300px">
        <br />
        The walk celebrates the famous plane tree which stands at the junction of Wood Street and Cheapside. 'Woody' is recognised as one of the oldest trees in London. Scant though records are, evidence points to it being planted at this spot 200 years ago.  
        <br />
        Over the centuries, the tree's location has had a major effect on history, literature, architecture, shopping and all manner of culture. 
        <br /> <br />
        London Guide Frank Molloy will be linking the walk to Deleuzian concepts of psychogeography and the 2022 Terminalia theme 'Wisdom'.
        <br />
        The walk includes a fantastic viewpoint of London, a visit to a City church and poetry readings.

      <p class="text">
        As part of the festival, we’re getting together to walk around campus. We are lucky to have some fine brutalist architecture and it would offer the chance to contemplate its apparent rejection of imitating nature, its softness and aesthetics.  
        <br />
        <br />

        If you’re around and would like to join in, meet us in Square 4 adjacent to The Hex at 4pm on Wednesday afternoon. The aim being to get us thinking about our connections to campus, nature, architecture, and wisdom. We even have a Knowledge Gateway on campus to visit, potentially tracing a boundary between earth and concrete. Be prepared for a dérive and bring whatever you might need to get creative.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
        "Impermanence, according to Thich Nhat Hanh, is something we must learn to appreciate
        its value, as it teaches us to respect all the precious things that we have around and within
        us at all times and to give them the right value"

        20th, 9.30AM-12.40PM. Individually or in small groups we will create a simple writing in the sand by the sea or on
the ground with a rake, a hoe or other useful tool. We will then take pictures of this
impermanent sign and make a small votive offering to the God Terminus. <br /> <br />
The frontier is the limit and the term can be expressed in many ways. This symbolic form
also wants to be a tribute to the Zen master Tich Nhat Hanh passed away on January 21.
The result of this action, which will take place on February 20, will then be shared on the 27th at 8pm-9pm on the web through the Google Meet platform / Facebook.

      <h3> 1pm Leeds UK, Tim Waters: Circular walk around medieval boundary of Leeds </h3>
    
    
      <p class="text">
        A return to the walk around the medieval boundary of Leeds, visiting the old stone markers (bars) and paying particular attention to the nearby
         moved, missing, open and closed Christian churches which in some cases had these markers embedded into the fabric of them. The location of the North Bar has been a common story of these walks of the years - did you know this stone was once sited into the walls of a chapel?
        <br />  <br />
        We will also hear the story of a moved cathedral and a missing skyline, visit the site of a pre-Reformation chantry chapel, pass by a vanished tee-totaller chapel, walk through graveyards and ponder about the relationship between the Trinity centre and the non-trinitarians.  
        <br />        <img src="img/past/2022/terminalia2021.png" height="300px" /><br />
        Responding to the theme of wisdom - it could be said that wisdom is a kind of applied and passed-down meaning to life - about the relationship between the spiritual life and the material world.  A church reflects this as a geographical boundary marker and a meeting place of above and below.

        <br />
        This circular walk around the centre of Leeds usually takes around 2 to 3 hours and there's a few steps in places, so participants should be reasonably fit.

        Celebrate Terminalia with a walk along the southern boundary of the Burgh of Govan, which was incorporated into Glasgow 110 years ago. Terminalia is the ancient Roman festival of boundaries, held on the last day of the Roman year, when citizens and landed proprietors processed round the edges of their property and praised Terminus, the god of boundaries, hoping for continued peace and stable borders.

This walk was originally made on foot with a live group in Edinburgh 3pm – sunset (5.30pm). It was an online tour for anyone who was ambulant or not, in Edinburgh or not! We toured part of the Leith boundary, the Rosebank Cemetery, the North Leith Burial Ground, and the streets in between, using a special format with information, photos, video, maps and conversation about the wonderful women associated with Leith’s past and contemporary connections. 
  </p>
  <p class="text-faded">
    The original tour was a circular one of approx. 2.5 hrs, to muse and meditate on boundaries and borders – between one community of people and another, day and night, life and death and on the cusp of the new moon. <br />
    We visited the graves of notable women in Rosebank Cemetery, North Leith Burial Ground and South Leith Parish Church. Briefly, at each stopping place, we faced the memorial stones, and learned about their incumbents. <br />

  <h3> Andrew Budd: Terminalia 2021 - on the brink</h3>


  <p class="text">
    <a href="https://sootallures.wixsite.com/topographersarms/post/terminalia-2021-on-the-brink"> Andrew Budd did a solo walk. </a>
    <br />

    "I’m almost out of bounds. I’m standing on the edge. I’m at the lowest point. But I’m feeling good....
    <br />
    I’m on my own today. It’s the pandemic, and I’m only allowed to walk with someone if it’s ‘exercise’. At this waterside I’m nearly half way round a five mile loop that I’d planned, and I’m fighting a blasting from the wind. It’s definitely exercise and not just a leisurely stroll. Today, I’m in a solitary mood, feeling that I need to be alone. I’m reflecting on life at present and wondering when we might get back to ‘normal’, when a group of friends can walk out together, and not have to worry about keeping our distance from each other. A time we can beat the bounds, collectively. Sounds like Terminalia 2022 will be a bigger celebration. But today, I’ve enjoyed the loneliness of the ‘enthusiast’ in a remote spot, in nature, in pursuit of his romantic ideas about history and geography, and his insignificance in the big scheme of everything else...


    <br />
    I have no garland or wine to offer to the God Terminus at this outpost boundary. But I thank him for keeping watch over me, on the brink."

  <p class="text">
    <a href="https://topoanimus.co.uk/2021/02/23/terminalia-2021/">Charlotte writes</a> that she usually joins the local walking tribes, Radical Stroud and Walking The Land in celebration for Terminalia. "This year, the Covid year, we have all walked today in solitude or in pairs." <br /> <br />
    "This year I had a yearning to explore boundaries of self and the landscape, to see if I could ‘let it in’. We have such a concept of ourselves as sovereign, largely impenetrable firmly contained within our bag of skin where ‘out there’ and ‘in here’ is so obvious as to be unconscious to most. And yet, we are constantly, intimately connected to each other and the outside in a fundamental and deeply intimate way. There is a constant flow and exchange through and with us and the world – through the air we inhale and the carbon dioxide we exhale, the food we eat and digest. All the things we sense that directly influence and affect our nervous systems, animating us, causing synapses to fire, chemical reactions to cascade, pupils to dilate, mouths to salivate – the list is endless.  The idea that we are somehow separate is a nonsense.
    <br />
    I also wanted to return to the longbarrows, and sit on that edge of on/under the earth and the present and the past.  I walked with Jon and dog Millie, who kept dog Fen in order – and as is not uncommon, the walk had a mind of it’s own and threw up unexpected considerations and synchronicities." <br />
    <img src="img/past/2021/20210223_215529.jpg" />
  </p>
  <p>
    "We started on Coaley Peak, and the walk from Nymphsfield Longbarrow to Hetty Peglars Tump was in itself a small study in boundaries, criss-crossing the road, and jumping walls into fields and following desire paths along hedgerow to avoid it. We spent time lying in the body-shaped hollows atop the tump, sheltered somewhat from the wind.".... 
  </p>
  <p>
    Once at home, it is time to carry out my personal Terminalia ritual. Three years ago on my first Terminalia walk, I consecrated my own Terminus stone. As close as I could get to the original Roman ritual, I libated it with local honey, wine, ashes from our hearth and in lieu of a sacrificial ram, I buried the jawbone of a lamb which I’d found on that day’s walk underneath it.  Since then, I have reconsecrated it each year on the 23 February. I also take water from our spring and bless the boundaries of our land (ie garden), with a prayer to Terminus based on permeable boundaries:
    <br />  <br />
    <blockquote>that all good be allowed to pass in, and all bad be kept out</blockquote>

        <h3>9.00 AM: New York City, USA. Line as labyrinth: Walking the urban labyrinth of desire. </h3>
        
        
        <p class="text">
          A labyrinth is not a maze, nor a puzzle to be solved, but a singular path to be traveled. One followed by choice.  One where the destination is clearly the journey, and time and the space for contemplation the purpose.
        <br />
        <br />

          A labyrinth is a line, often considered as a line convoluted, with compounded twists and turns.  The very word labyrinthine is a term to describe that which is complicated and intricate. But at its core, at the heart of it, a labyrinth is just a line.  One without distractions, one without choices and options.  It is a singular line to follow.  One that is chosen by the walker, not forced upon them by the built environment.  The invitation to walk a labyrinth is just that, an invitation.  It is not a demand, or even a request.  It is an option. One chosen when you feel the need, the pull, the desire. The desire to take on a path, or a pilgrimage.  To set out with an intention, a question. It works best when you don’t try to answer that question, but just walk with the question, and see how it changes, and reveals more of itself, with each footstep. 
          <br />
          <br />
          
          According to some urban planning experts, Broadway was New York City’s earliest desire line, following as it does the Native American-made Wickquasgeck Path, which is thought to have been the shortest walking route between pre-colonial settlements in Manhattan. Broadway is the only remaining one path, according to Architect and urban planner Riccardo Marini, that “wasn’t wiped out by the European grid being overlaid on it”.  In this work this path of desire becomes the line of a labyrinth progressing through the city. A singular line progressing from the most northern to the most southern tips of Manhattan.  This line becomes an urban labyrinth of desire. 
        

        </p>
        <p class="text-faded">
          Christopher Kaczmarek invites any who feel the need, pull or aspiration to undertaking a walking pilgrimage to join him down the urban labyrinth of desire that is the street of Broadway. We will begin at 09.00 on Sunday morning February 23, 2020.

        <h3>10.00am Stroud, UK. "Beating the Bounds" of Rodborough Parish </h3>
        
        
        <p class="text">
          In honour of the Roman God of boundaries we will walk around the limits of the parish of Rodborough.  
        </p>

          <p>
          Parishes were once very important administrative areas and ceremonially walking the boundaries of a parish (known as “Beating the Bounds”) was a significant local custom in many places.  Important boundary landmarks such as trees or stones would be ceremonially beaten with birch or willow rods.  Sometimes young boys (typically choir boys) would also be ceremonially beaten at key places (supposedly to ensure that they would remember the parish boundaries!).
        </p>
        <p>
          On this walk we intend to revive certain aspects of this custom for one day.  Specifically, walking the boundary and beating key landmarks, but most definitely NOT beating young boys.  As we progress there will be discussions and performative celebration of local matters, historical, political, industrial, cultural, geological, ecological and mythological.  The boundary of Rodborough parish follows canals and disused railway lines, makes steep ascents and descents of beautiful Cotswold valleys and crosses the limestone grassland of an ancient common.

          Approximately 8 miles.  Allow 6 hours. Bring refreshments and food. Towpaths and footpaths and some very steep climbs / descents.  Several stiles to cross. <br />
          The walk will start and end at Stroud Railway station.  Map ref SO 84973 05124.  Meet in the forecourt for a 10.00 am start.

  <h3>1.30pm: Leeds, UK. Desire Paths - walking to the stones</h3>
  <p class="text">
    We shall explore the desire lines of Leeds from Hyde Park Corner, through Woodhouse Moor, across the University campus and into the city centre.  Be on the look out for desire paths, short cuts and corrections by authorities.
    <br />
We shall finish at one of the ancient stones or "bars" in the centre of Leeds to commemorate the boundaries. 
  </p><p>
    
The Situationists (the somewhat more zany political wing of psychogeography) say that people need to become conscious of their hidden and un-expressed desires before they can reach a new world, rather than just following another set of political aims, persons or prescriptions for action.  Perhaps desire paths and lines are visible traces of people's desire of an alternate reality? Or perhaps it's just a short cut to the shops!
  </p>

  <p class="text-faded">
    Meet 1.30 in the pub garden outside the Hyde Park Corner Pub. If it's raining we will be inside the pub. Look for the man carrying a folded Ordnance Survey map.  The walk should take an hour or two. It will end in the centre of Leeds. Ground should mostly be flat and in general is downhill.

  <h3>14:00 Berlin, Germany: Erasing the line: From no man's land to tram line</h3>


  <p class="text">
    If Berlin had Terminus worshippers, who erected milestones and border
    markers, he would have been well served in the years between 1961 and
    1989 when the city was divided by a wall and in so many other ways.
    Walls, barbed wire, observation towers and even borders on the middle of
    the river were all borders set to divide the city during the Cold War.
    The people counteracted with secret tunnels and daring escapes.
  </p>
  <p>
    For Terminalia, we will explore one of the ways in which the
disappearence of the wall has enabled new life in the city, namely along
the line of the Tram M10. A large part of the tram itinerary was only
made possible because it runs for a long stretch where the no man´s land
between the Berlin Wall and East Berlin was placed. After the Wall was
gone, this empty stretch of land became a park, a site of worship and it
even has its own little field where rye is planted and harvested each
year. Life came back to the whole area -new buildings, shops, a memorial
museum, a flea market, an open air gallery, murals that stretch along
whole buildings...and the tram line M10 breathes life into all of this
new land. Also called "the party line" it connects the main train
station with two other neighbourhoods in the former East Berlin,
Prenzlauer Berg and Friedrichshain, where there is an active party and
night life. This line is as busy in the wee hours of the morning on
Fridays and Saturdays as it is during rush hour during a week day. Were
it not for the memorial site and the open air gallery, you would not
know that the Wall once determined the life of so many people by setting
borders.
  </p>
  <p>
    During Terminalia, we will walk along part of the route of M10 tram
line, exploring where reminders of these divisions still exist and where
the division is no longer visible. We invite photographers and urban
sketchers to join, to document the Festivalia activities in Berlin.
After the walk, we invite participants to a friendly exchange at a
nearby Bar or Cafe along the way, where we can share photos, sketches or
stories.

  <h3>2pm, Arlington, Texas, USA: A Little Walkward </h3>


  <p class="text">
    Members of the feminist collective Sister Death invite friends and strangers to move with us through Veteran's Park in Arlington, Texas. We'll cross the boundary between awkward conversation and thoughtful chatting, getting to know the park and each other as we discover common ground in a era of division. Starting at the Veteran's Memorial, we'll follow the park's mile-long, accessible, paved pathway through open fields, woods, and a floral wildscape. All are welcome, including pets on leashes. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Sister Death is a band of four artists: Christine Adame, Holly D. Gray, Billi London-Gray and Marcela Reyes. As a feminist collective, we focus on empowering women and achieving gender equality. Our collective actions range from simple gestures — such as sending encouraging text messages, forwarding job opportunities, and carpooling — to complex collaborations and solidarity actions.

  <h3>2.21pm Crosscanonby, West Cumbria, UK.  Beyond the Wall: Milefortlet 21</h3>


  <p class="text">
    Meet at 2.21h to go to Fortlet 21. Meeting place is outside Crosscanonby Carr Nature Reserve 'a mosaic of wetland, meadows, woodland, which is a haven for animals, birds and plants', and was once an abandoned car park. From there we walk to the medieval saltpans at the coast, and onwards to the Milefortlet at the edge of the Roman Universe. This fortlet was established to catch out those who went round Hadrian's Wall via the sea on the westside (Irish Sea). <br />
     Once there, we'll make an offering to Terminus. - and remember those who tried to beat the Wall in this way (and all those who are trying to overcome walls today).

  <h3>2.45pm, Nijmegen, Netherlands. Terminalia Noviomagus</h3>


  <p class="text">
    The ancient Terminalia festival was celebrated on the last day of the Roman calendar year: February 23. This holiday centered on one of the oldest Roman gods, Terminus, a mysterious and largely forgotten deity who was often represented as a physical object in the form of the stone boundary markers guarding the outer limits of the Roman territory. But Terminus was imagined to hold influence over less physical boundaries too, like that between two months, or between two groups of people.
    <br /><br />
    In honor of this ancient Roman tradition, the annual Terminalia Festival of Psychogeography hosts walks exploring the theme of ‘borders’ in various locations all over the world. In the Netherlands, this year’s celebration will take place in Nijmegen, where the Romans built a military fortress around 100BC which served for almost two centuries as a flourishing border post of their Empire.
    <br /><br />
    This participatory walk with choreographic and textual elements will explore the identities of Nijmegen as a city of borders which have accumulated and transformed over the course of twenty centuries of history. Around 4.30 PM, we will halt at Café de Zon on the island of Veur-Lent. From there, participants will have the option of returning home or continuing onward to experience a specially staged denouement to Terminalia Noviomagus at sunset. At the closing of the walk, all participants are welcome to join us for the Terminalia Bacchanalia at a hipster bistro in the Honigcomplex. 
    <br /><br />
 
  </p>
  <p class="text-faded">
    Point of departure: Tony Cragg’s nameless sculpture on the Stationsplein, 3 PM <br />

    Please join me (Tamsin Grainger) in a circular walking tour (of approx. 2.5 hrs) to muse and meditate on boundaries and borders - between one community of people and another, day and night, life and death and on the cusp of the new moon. We will be visiting the graves of notable women in Rosebank Cemetery, North Leith Burial Ground and South Leith Parish Church. Briefly, at each stopping place, we will face the memorial stones, and have the chance to learn about their incumbents. The steps taken from one to the next, will be equally, if not more, important - an opportunity for exchange or silent contemplation on these topics. I hope to make a map after, and of, this event that will contain some of its psychogeography.

  <h3> 7PM GMT: Birmingham, UK: Dark Moon Walking</h3>


  <p class="text">
    An expedition into the darkest recesses of Stirchley and Bournville in south Birmingham. <br />

    As the New Moon begins this Terminalia, we shall reclaim the night by walking out of the street lights and into the darkest corners of Birmingham B30.<br />
    
    By day our route is green and pleasant, traversing parks, canal paths and verdant walkways. By night we shall discover how different it all looks and feels when the path is not lit, the trees loom large and all colour disappears? Will there be fear or excitement, a feeling of power or of vulnerability?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    This one-hour night walk offers the chance to venture into the unlit borderlands of Bournville, Stirchley and Lifford wards in the safety of a group. To blend into the darkness and embrace the power of our invisibility. To explore our inner fears as well as a sense of awe and wonder. By walking together, we aim to reclaim the everyday urban spaces that become off-limits after dark.<br />
    
    There will be short breaks along the way to contemplate the darkness or just to blend into the shadows, become invisible and think.<br />
    

  </p>
  <p class="text-faded">
    Organised by new <a href="http://walkspace.uk/">West Midlands walking collective, Walkspace</a>. Spaces are limited so booking is essential. The walk will start and end at Bournville train station ticket office, setting off at 7pm on Sunday 23rd February.<br />

  <h3>Patrick S Ford , Yiu Lai Lei, Vietnam. Saigon Canal Walk</h3>
  <p>Patrick  will be conducting a walk by the canals of Saigon, accompanied by a fellow walker - Nina Yiu Lai Lei around the canals that were once a feature of the city. Most of them have long since disappeared, some of them were filled in and became streets or boulevards such as Nguyen Hue 'Walking Street' in District 1.<br /><br />
     To commemorate this year's Terminalia festival, they will begin on Le Than Ton (which marked the old citadel wall), progress South East along Nguyen Hue, turn left along Ton Due Thang and then left again along the North Eastern side of Thi Sách. When they again reached Le Than Ton, the would then return to my starting point near to the People's Committee hall.

        <p class="text">
          Celebrate Terminalia Glasguensis on Saturday 23 February with a walk around the boundaries of the ancient town, following the River Clyde, the Molendinar and the St Enoch Burn. Terminalia is the ancient Roman festival of boundaries, held on the last day of the Roman year, when citizens and landed proprietors processed round the edges of their property and praised Terminus, the god of boundaries, for continued peace and stable borders.
        </p>
        <p class="text-faded">
          The walk begins in Glasgow city centre at 10.30 am, and will last around three hours. Bring drinks and snacks to share, and a small item to leave behind at a boundary point.

        <h3>11am Seasalter, Kent: A Walk with Thread and Word in Seasalter for Terminalia </h3>
        
        
        <p class="text">
          Through Thread and Word we are organising a collaborative walk -  inviting participation with interventions and eco-poetry in Seasalter which is between Whitstable and Faversham in Kent. There is a proposal to build 1,000s of solar panels, along part of our route through Seasalter which will decimate the surrounding environment.
          <br />

          The walk will focus on the boundaries between alternative ways of producing energy and our surrounding environment and natural habitat. We already have a boundary sea wall to protect the surrounding land from the sea ..... as well as a boundary for fishing for bait .... (which we walked last year) and a graveyard of old Groynes to protect the beaches.
          <br />
          The walk on Saturday Feb 23rd as part of Terminalia Festival which celebrates the Roman God of boundaries Terminus, will use the surrounding countryside to explore ideas and consider where we draw the line as we try to protect our environment. We will use threads to record our thoughts as we respond to the surrounding landscape and poetry readings chosen from the eco -poetry archive to inspire our thoughts related to the area. 
          <br />
          We will end up in a local pub 😊 where we will write a short declaration of findings it might even be a poem! I hope you can join us. 
    
        </p>
        <p class="text-faded">
          Meeting for a 11am start from outside the Sportsman in Seasalter. The walk would last about an hour and a half walking on mostly flat terrain. <br />
          Also visit the <a href="https://www.faversham.org/events/arts-and-music/a-walk-for-terminalia-with-thread-and-word">Faversham council listing</a> of the walk.

        <h3>12pm Barbican, London: The Act of Walking - Paving the Streets of London. </h3>
        
        
        <p class="text">
          This walk will start at White Cross Street but we will meet prior outside Barbican underground station at 12pm, it will last one hour, following the route of the 1542 Paving Act. Due to the walk having various stops and changing with the context of each experience, its end location remains unknown but will be somewhere along this route. The route will raise questions around human impact on the environment and urban topographies, whilst exploring the significance of the pavings history from all the way back in 1542 to the evidence of history from yesterday.  We will explore the stones themselves, the cracks in them, the litter on top, the chewing gum tarred into them and finally the pebbles and the dirt.

        <p class="text">
          Join us on an mission to find The Infinite Lawn, a surreal exploration into urban sprawl and the continued
          greyifaction of the urban environment, as we attempt to walk a seamless greenbelt through the city by only
          permitting grass, moss or other flora to pass underfoot. <br />
      
          Taking our cue from Italo Calvino's novel Mr. Palomar, we will practically explore the questions the novel raises
          around the symbolism and perceived homogeneity of the well manicured lawn, and the use of managed horticulture as
          public and private status symbols and boundaries. <br />
      
          Join us on February 23rd for an epic hop, skip and jump across Swansea.

        <h3>2.30pm Barletta, Apulia, Italy: "The Scenes of Crimini" Among the Perimeters of the Ancient Walls of Barletta </h3>
          
          
        <p class="text">
          After organizing, a few years ago, a temporary installation made of metal nets and enveloped and classified waste called "The crime scene" in Cassano Murge. The "garden of scraps" was an operation accomplished by collecting elements and garbage of all kinds and shown to the public in one of the most important squares for a few weeks. <br />

         During the Festival of Psychogeography 2018, our journey took place in the direction of Porta Marina and then we crossed the Walls of Carmine and stopped at the Paraticchio, there we laid a chaplet of symbolic laurels to practice our ritual dedicated to Terminalia. Then we went along the borders that are no longer there ... the probable track of the beaten sixteenth-century city walls. In Piazza Castello, we placed another small laurel wreath at the foot of the monument to the missing in the sea <br />
         This year for the Festival we propose a singular "walk" between the perimeter that contains very particular "boundaries" of the ancient center in the city of Barletta: "The Scenes of Crimini" Among the Perimeters of the Ancient Walls of Barletta <br />
         The crime scene proposed here is a sort of identification of very singular places within the medieval walls where they were carried out in remote times acts of brutal violence: murders, murderers etc.  We can imagine how many episodes may have occurred in ancient times in the square in front of the castle, along the walls of the Carmine, between the streets of the village! Returning through these tales and symbolic geolocalizations these particular boundaries, Pursing of the "titles" or symbolic stick stickers on the walls of the palaces, between the streets of the medieval nucleus is an operation that symbolically re-enacts buried episodes and forgotten tames ... ..In the so-called seaside village among the humble houses or the ancient palaces of civilians, between churches and buildings inhabited by monks / nuns. In the building next to the church of Sant 'Andrea, turned into a prison how many violences were consumed?  <br />In this way, we will perform a performance in which we will reactivate one of these criminal incidents, now forgotten, which took place in Barletta.
         <br />
         The episodes we will mention are:   <br />
         1) The massacre of the Terlizzesi occurred on 10 January 1899 near the disappearance "Porta Nuova", where the two brothers Baldassare da Terlizzi lost their lives  <br />
         2) Aggression to the Evangelical Community in March 1866 that cost the lives of 4 people, of which only one of evangelical faith occurred near Via del Pesce.
        </p>
        <p class="text-faded">
          Schedule <br />
          14:30 Piazza Aldo Moro: Talk on  Baldassare da Terlizzi murders <br />
          15.15 Walk around walls<br />
          16:00 Via Fieramosca: Talk "Le porte del morto".<br />

        <h3>3pm Utrecht, the Netherlands: The Lazy End</h3>

        <p class="text">
          The ancient Terminalia festival is particularly meaningful for the city of Utrecht, where ancient Romans once built
          a military fort on what is now the Domplein, marking the northernmost border of their vast empire.<br />
          Starting at that very real Terminus (a God represented by a temporal or spatial boundary marker), this open participative walk will
          take us southwards to one of the city's storied streets - the Gansstraat. This street, bordered by a prison on one
          end and a cemetery on the other, is popularly known by its nickname <i>The Lazy End</i>, where <i></i>"on one side they sit
          [captive], and on the other they lie."</i> While walking down to The Lazy End, we will playfully explore Utrecht's many
          identities as a 'center' or 'boundary' and dwell on the notion of ending in life and times. <br />
          Depending on weather conditions, we may indulge in a brief lie-in at the cemetery before the group returns to the
          city center for Terminalia Bacchanalia in a bar near het <i>Ledig Erf</i>.
        </p>
        <p class="text-faded">
          This walk is organized by Ienke Kastelein and Witold van Ratingen.
          <br />
          Starting point: by the passage underneath the Domkerk. 15.00. <br />

          <p class="text">
            Leeds - Beating the Bounds. Bring treats to share, flowers to leave and drinks to keep you warm! With events, interventions, and special performances from local artists. <br />
            We will be walking in an anti-clockwise direction around the city, visiting the ancient boundary stone markers that defined the medieval boundaries of the city. Traditionally, feasting and sacrifices were performed during Terminalia at boundary markers, and we will do the same with things like poetry, cake, flowers or a drink! The boundary markers around Leeds are called bars (gates, possibly that barred off an entrance) and mark the borders where the city ended and the countryside began. Most are recorded and some still exist. <br />
            This year as we will be walking during the day we will be able to see the Burley Bar Stone which is inside a bank! <br />

        <p class="text">
          The folks at <a href="http://www.radicalstroud.co.uk">Radical Stroud</a> have a walk planned for Stroud
          involving three very different interactions with boundaries and
          landmarks: spatial, temporal and linguistic.
          <br /> <br />
          <b>1.</b> Meet at the <a href="http://upperlockcafe.co.uk/">Upper Lockkeeper’s Café</a> at 10am when
          <b>Jon Seagrave</b> will explain how the shadowy operatives of Stroud & District Psychogeography and Deep
          Topography Commission
          are attempting a 'subjective remapping' of the town, asking for YOUR assistance in locating the unseen
          energies that
          shape and guide our everyday actions here in the bosom of the Five Valleys. Where did YOU have your first
          kiss? Where
          do YOU go when you want tranquillity, or fancy a fist-fight? Help identify Aggression Hotpots, Enlightenment
          Nodes and
          Knee-Trembler Clusters! Ritual Pilgrimages and Fertility Dances may result!
          <br /> <br />

          <b>2.</b>
          <b>Robin Treefellow</b> will take us on a guided walk to Woodchester Roman Villa where we will slip through
          all manner of
          wormholes of Time.
          <br /> <br />
          <b>3.</b> We will then walk up Water Lane to the long barrow at Selsley where
          <b>Stuart Butler</b> will take us on a brief history of swearing: the boundaries between the sacred and the
          profane; the
          elemental and excremental; the physical and the psychical; by Janus and ...
          <br /> Robin Treefellow will also talk of the two names of this barrow: The Toots and the Blacklow – it was
          the site of the
          old Saxon hundred moot called Blacklow Hundred. Folk still like to gather there!
          <br /> We will finish with a toast to Faunus.

        <h3>11am, Seasalter, nr Whistable. Walking with The Waste Land </h3>


        <p class="text">
          On Friday the 23rd of February,
          members from the walking group
          Walking with The Waste Land and their
          friends will be conducting a walk from
          the Sportsman Car Park in Seasalter,
          near Whitstable, in Kent. We will meet at
          11a.m. in order to catch the low tide at
          11.47.
        </p>
        <p>
          On this walk we will walk to "Mick’s
          post" from here we will experiment with
          some low tide mud walking, using knots
          in ropes to record the experience. <br />
          We will then return to Mick’s post where
          where we will tie the knotted ropes to
          Mick’s post in a symbolic ritual of the celebration of Terminus.

        </p>
        <p class="text-faded">
          Mick’s post is a white post in Seasalter which has been erected near the sea wall to indicate the
          boundary for the digging of bait in the estuary. <br />

        <h3>12pm. Colchester. Ruth Raymer: Beating the Bounds Around the Walls of Colchester Town </h3>


        <p class="text">
          In honour of Terminalia, Ruth and you will be walking around the walls of Colchester town in Essex - the
          oldest and longest town wall still surviving in Britain today, 'beating the bounds' and taking in the
          breathtaking views of the town and its environs. Colchester prides itself on being the oldest recorded town
          in Britain. The Roman wall is home to some of the <a href="http://www.romanwall.org/?page_id=347">rarest
            mosses and lichens</a> and if you look really hard you may even find one of the remaining ammonite fossils
          in the wall. Odd finds such as the slice of wall sitting beside pizza place all add to the curiosity of this
          ancient structure.
        </p>
        <p class="text-faded">
          We will depart from the Firstsite Gallery Cafe at noon on Friday 23rd Feb - find address and map here: <a

        <h3> 5.30pm, Leeds. Beating the Bounds Walk - Circular walk around our boundary of Leeds</h3>

        <p class="text">5.30pm Route planning, dowsing and map browsing for a strict 6pm departure from the bar at <a
            href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/204237011">Wharf Chambers Co-op Club</a> . 2 hrs (easy). Bring
          treats to share, flowers to leave and alcoholic or soft drinks to keep you warm! With events, interventions,
          and special performances from local artists. Led by Tim Waters
        </p>

        <p class="text">
          A slightly different format to past years, we will find, in addition to the medieval stones, our own boundary
          markers of the city. Using crystal dowsing techniques over maps in the bar beforehand participants will plot
          out a route to follow within the city centre. Walkers will then head out to explore the divined places and
          examine whats there and uncover boundary indicators. Once done (or after a set amount of time), examining our
          new boundary markers and the map, we will head inwards to find the centre. At each newly found marker, we
          shall celebrate the boundary with snacks, drinks and flowers, do please bring some to share!
        </p>

        <p class="text-faded">
          We're happy to report that 2018 finds all the medieval boundary markers of Leeds, the bars, marked with blue
          plaques and/or uncovered. Our actions over the years has been successful! This year we will seek in addition
          to explore the city by finding new boundary places. The medieval boundary stones marked out the limits of the
          medieval city, and the entrances and toll booths for animals and trade. Terminus is also the god of non
          physical boundaries such as time and seasons and relationships. How has the city changed from ancient times -
          can we ask our unconcious minds where these new marks would or should be?
        </p>



        <h4>Beating the Bounds: Additional Interventions and Performances</h4>

        <p class="text-faded">
          <a href="http://hud.academia.edu/SimonBradley">Simon Bradley</a> will perform a guided tour of his "Pocket
          Museum of Displacements" at a location along the walk.
        </p>

        <p class="text-faded">
          <a href="https://twitter.com/anzrboo">Anzir Boodoo</a> will perform a traditional Roman blessing at a
          suitable spot along the walk - possibly including an invocation to a Roman river god.
        </p>

        <p class="text-faded">
          Meet 5.30pm at <a href="http://www.wharfchambers.org/">Wharf Chambers</a> bar to be part of the essential
          dowsing, divination and route planning activity. We will leave the bar at 6pm sharp.<br />

        <h3> 6.30pm, Statford, London, Tapping Into The City: Group Walk - Stratford </h3>


        <p class="text">
          Tapping Into The City looks at our movements through private-public space in the city, the impact of urban
          surroundings on us and our relations with each other.
          <br />
          Come and join in this live art piece - a group walk around Stratford - one of London's most overtly
          regenerated areas and centres of privatised-public space (Westfield Stratford City, Queen Elizabeth Olympic
          Park and East Village are all within walking distance).
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Friday 23rd February, 6.30pm. Meeting point - at the bottom of the Meridian Steps (the stairs leading up to
          Westfield, next to the bus and underground station and opposite Stratford Centre).
          <br />
          Nathania will explain the piece and then we'll walk together for an hour or so, simply moving as one through
          the city space, listening to its sound and the sound of our feet. Afterwards we can retreat to a warm pub
          nearby. Ideally we'll wear shoes with pennies stuck to the soles.
        </p>
        <p class="text-faded">
          All welcome! Free, but please book on Eventbrite to secure your space - <a class=" " href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/terminalia-festival-tapping-into-the-city-group-walk-stratford-tickets-42866867956">Tapping

        <h3>6.30. Dalston, London: #DiviningDalston - Wonder Wander around Ridley Road and Dalston</h3>


        <p class="text">
          It's Terminalia Festival of Psychogeography, so after years of informally exploring and documenting Dalston,
          Hackney Tours
          is pairing up with cult Ridley Road gallery space Doomed to host another Hackney Tours Wonder Wander in this
          fascinating
          and culturally rich area.
          <br />
          Hackney Tours has been combing the borough since 2009 and recording the results (see here for examples) while
          Doomed
          have been running deliberately non-commericial shows with a strong photography element and hosting
          alternative free education
          sessions by arts academics.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Join some interesting fellow travellers to stimulate your grey matter. Tour guides, photographers,
          philosophers, thinkers...
          <br />
          Dust off your Debord and let's take our very own Dérive (Drift) – making our own fun as we explore the
          backstreets and
          create our own psychogeographical work.
          <br />
          Don't be intimidated by any of the big French words, it's really just about being open and receptive to
          what's around
          you and taking a moment to stop and smell the flowers. That's what I call a 'wonder wander'. Your opinion and
          thoughts
          about what you see and experience are what's important, not what a textbook says.
          <br />
          We might make some amateur maps, take some photos, or create a narrative. It's not rocket science - but it is
          fun!
          <br />
          WE WILL, OF COURSE, FINISH IN A PUB OR ENVIRONMENT CONDUSIVE TO HYDRATED DEBATE....

                Women Who Walk Network members, friends and curious passersby are invited to take a dérive to celebrate the festival of Terminalia.
                In a tribute to the borderless and liminal, this synchronised walk links to the wider Terminalia Festival. Dérive as you
                like it – try one of these provocations or just follow your curiosity: 1. Walk with friends, family or colleagues. Seek
                synchronicity. Discuss your findings. 2. Disobey signage. Defy walls and boundaries. Walk in a straight line as far as
                you can. 3. Incorporate a catapult. Flip a coin at junctions. Follow your nose, or a noise, or an annoyance.
                <br /> Then share your experiences with fellow celebrants: For instant sharing, tweet while you walk. Upload thoughts, findings
                or images to
                <a href="https://twitter.com/womenwhowalknet">@womenwhowalknet</a> so Sonia can retweet them. Use

                Prepare for the Beating the Bounds walk by exploring the spatial and temporal limits of a lunchtime at Kirkgate Market, Leeds.
                <br /> Meet at 12.40 by the M&S clock, in the 1904 hall for a crowd-sourced tour of the largest covered market in Europe. Following
                our noses for around 25 mins we'll create a spontaneous platter map of vernacular gastronomy and then sit down to destroy

                of our social history. The walk reimagines the market through Hayley's personal stories and experiences, and invites the
                participants to share some of their own along the way. To do this she has
                <a href="img/ball_thread.jpg">a ball of thread</a>, which she will unravel as we walk, and tie knots in to remember each story as it unfolds.

                David Bollinger will spark off the Beating the Bounds walk with a short ritual sacrifice to the other Goddess of Psychogeography:
                Vesta. Vesta (or Hestia as the Greeks called her) is the goddess of liminal spaces, thresholds and hearths. Her place was
                the fireplace, the central hearth in every home. As another boundary entity she was responsible for the centre and thresholds,
                the boundary between spaces (Hermes is the god of travelling across boundaries and you know about Terminus). Sacrifices
                to this domestic, very early primitive goddess was often seen as being done for no reward, literally "going up in smoke."

                We will be walking widdershins (anti-clockwise) around the city, visiting the ancient boundary markers that defined the medieval
                boundaries of the city. Traditionally, feasting and dances were performed during Terminalia at boundary markers, and we
                will do the same with things with cake, flowers and a drink! The boundary markers around Leeds are called bars (gates,
                possibly that barred off an entrance) and mark the borders where the city ended and the countryside began. Some stone markers
                still exist.</p>

              <p class="text">
                Tapping Into The City looks at our movements through private-public space in the city, the impact of urban surroundings on
                us and our relations with each other.
                <br /> Come and join in this live art piece/group walk through the city, starting at Regent's Place. Nathania will explain the
                piece and then we'll walk together for an hour or so. Afterwards we can retreat to a warm pub nearby. No need for expertise, to practice or to perform - we will simply explore and respond to our surroundings and each other by moving as one through the city space and listening to its sound and the sound of our feet. Ideally we'll wear shoes with pennies stuck to the  soles.

                    <p>
                        Sound artist Phill Harding will lead a silent walk of rapid passage and high velocity through central Leeds following a dynamic algorithmically derived route.

                        <h4>* Leeds - Beating the Bounds 6pm eeting in The North Bar Pub, North Street, then around the city. Free. </h4>

                        Leeds - Beating the Bounds - Circular walk around medieval boundary of Leeds. Bring treats to share, flowers to leave and drinks to keep you warm! With events, interventions, and special performances from local artists. More details coming soon. We will be walking in an clockwise direction around the city, visiting the ancient boundary stone markers that defined the medieval boundaries of the city. Traditionally, feasting and sacrifices were performed during Terminalia at boundary
                        markers, and we will do the same with things like poetry, cake, flowers or a drink! The boundary markers around Leeds are called bars (gates, possibly that barred off an entrance) and mark the borders where the city ended and the countryside began. Most are recorded and some still exist.

                        <h5> Simon Bradley: Displacement Activity</h5>
                        A special Displacement Activities intervention involving the group participating in a sonic boundary ritual will occur at some undisclosed part of the walk.

                        <h5> Performances</h5>
                        Anzir Boodoo will perform a traditional Roman blessing at the city's transport termini. The walk may also visit the new glittering southern entrance to the railway station where an invocation to a Roman river god will be enacted as we stand over the water.

                        <h5>Mapping the intangible.</h5>
                        This year our walk will include the opportunity to contribute to a new map of the city which will endeavor to contain some of our thoughts, feelings, memories and insights about the experience of Leeds. Liz Cable, Senior Lecturer in Digital Narratives at Leeds Trinity University will collate and curate your responses to the prompts of the city, and your experience of the Festival: photographs, doodles, memories, prose, poetry, sounds, commentary. What memories do we leave behind as as we walk into the new year. What wishes do we have for this city? Our collection will be mapped onto the city using augmented reality and available for download and re-experience as a mobile app.

                      CELEBRATE TERMINALIA - the festival of Terminus - Roman god of boundaries on Saturday 23rd February, 2pm Leeds.

  We will be walking in a clockwise direction around the city, visiting the ancient boundary markers that defined the medieval boundaries of the city. Traditionally, feasting and sacrifices were performed during Terminalia at boundary markers, and we will do the same with things like poetry, cake, flowers or a drink! The boundary markers around Leeds are called bars (gates, possibly that barred off an entrance) and mark the borders where the city ended and the countryside began. Most are recorded and some still exist. In addition to the historical boundaries that we encounter, you are invited to discover the hidden and not so hidden boundaries and borders that are concrete, social, political or virtual in the city.

  Meet at 2:00 for a 2:15 departure at the North Bar bar (24 New Briggate) then clockwise to the East Bar by the Parish Church, then onto the South Bar, (Adelphi comfort stop) then to the West Bar, near City Square and onto the Burley Bar (Woodhouse Lane, and should be viewable this year!) and completing the circle back at the North Bar for further festivities.
