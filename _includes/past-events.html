                Women Who Walk Network members, friends and curious passersby are invited to take a dérive to celebrate the festival of Terminalia.
                In a tribute to the borderless and liminal, this synchronised walk links to the wider Terminalia Festival. Dérive as you
                like it – try one of these provocations or just follow your curiosity: 1. Walk with friends, family or colleagues. Seek
                synchronicity. Discuss your findings. 2. Disobey signage. Defy walls and boundaries. Walk in a straight line as far as
                you can. 3. Incorporate a catapult. Flip a coin at junctions. Follow your nose, or a noise, or an annoyance.
                <br /> Then share your experiences with fellow celebrants: For instant sharing, tweet while you walk. Upload thoughts, findings
                or images to
                <a href="https://twitter.com/womenwhowalknet">@womenwhowalknet</a> so Sonia can retweet them. Use

              <p class="text">
                Prepare for the Beating the Bounds walk by exploring the spatial and temporal limits of a lunchtime at Kirkgate Market, Leeds.
                <br /> Meet at 12.40 by the M&S clock, in the 1904 hall for a crowd-sourced tour of the largest covered market in Europe. Following
                our noses for around 25 mins we'll create a spontaneous platter map of vernacular gastronomy and then sit down to destroy
                it with our teeth and taste buds.

                years. The tour explores peoples’ connections to the market and to each other, and shows why markets are an important part
                of our social history. The walk reimagines the market through Hayley's personal stories and experiences, and invites the
                participants to share some of their own along the way. To do this she has
                <a href="img/ball_thread.jpg">a ball of thread</a>, which she will unravel as we walk, and tie knots in to remember each story as it unfolds.

                David Bollinger will spark off the Beating the Bounds walk with a short ritual sacrifice to the other Goddess of Psychogeography:
                Vesta. Vesta (or Hestia as the Greeks called her) is the goddess of liminal spaces, thresholds and hearths. Her place was
                the fireplace, the central hearth in every home. As another boundary entity she was responsible for the centre and thresholds,
                the boundary between spaces (Hermes is the god of travelling across boundaries and you know about Terminus). Sacrifices
                to this domestic, very early primitive goddess was often seen as being done for no reward, literally "going up in smoke."

                We will be walking widdershins (anti-clockwise) around the city, visiting the ancient boundary markers that defined the medieval
                boundaries of the city. Traditionally, feasting and dances were performed during Terminalia at boundary markers, and we
                will do the same with things with cake, flowers and a drink! The boundary markers around Leeds are called bars (gates,
                possibly that barred off an entrance) and mark the borders where the city ended and the countryside began. Some stone markers
                still exist.</p>

              <p class="text">
                Tapping Into The City looks at our movements through private-public space in the city, the impact of urban surroundings on
                us and our relations with each other.
                <br /> Come and join in this live art piece/group walk through the city, starting at Regent's Place. Nathania will explain the
                piece and then we'll walk together for an hour or so. Afterwards we can retreat to a warm pub nearby. No need for expertise, to practice or to perform - we will simply explore and respond to our surroundings and each other by moving as one through the city space and listening to its sound and the sound of our feet. Ideally we'll wear shoes with pennies stuck to the  soles.

                    <p>
                        Sound artist Phill Harding will lead a silent walk of rapid passage and high velocity through central Leeds following a dynamic algorithmically derived route.

                        <h4>* Leeds - Beating the Bounds 6pm eeting in The North Bar Pub, North Street, then around the city. Free. </h4>

                        Leeds - Beating the Bounds - Circular walk around medieval boundary of Leeds. Bring treats to share, flowers to leave and drinks to keep you warm! With events, interventions, and special performances from local artists. More details coming soon. We will be walking in an clockwise direction around the city, visiting the ancient boundary stone markers that defined the medieval boundaries of the city. Traditionally, feasting and sacrifices were performed during Terminalia at boundary
                        markers, and we will do the same with things like poetry, cake, flowers or a drink! The boundary markers around Leeds are called bars (gates, possibly that barred off an entrance) and mark the borders where the city ended and the countryside began. Most are recorded and some still exist.

                        <h5> Simon Bradley: Displacement Activity</h5>
                        A special Displacement Activities intervention involving the group participating in a sonic boundary ritual will occur at some undisclosed part of the walk.

                        <h5> Performances</h5>
                        Anzir Boodoo will perform a traditional Roman blessing at the city's transport termini. The walk may also visit the new glittering southern entrance to the railway station where an invocation to a Roman river god will be enacted as we stand over the water.

                        <h5>Mapping the intangible.</h5>
                        This year our walk will include the opportunity to contribute to a new map of the city which will endeavor to contain some of our thoughts, feelings, memories and insights about the experience of Leeds. Liz Cable, Senior Lecturer in Digital Narratives at Leeds Trinity University will collate and curate your responses to the prompts of the city, and your experience of the Festival: photographs, doodles, memories, prose, poetry, sounds, commentary. What memories do we leave behind as as we walk into the new year. What wishes do we have for this city? Our collection will be mapped onto the city using augmented reality and available for download and re-experience as a mobile app.

                      CELEBRATE TERMINALIA - the festival of Terminus - Roman god of boundaries on Saturday 23rd February, 2pm Leeds.

  We will be walking in a clockwise direction around the city, visiting the ancient boundary markers that defined the medieval boundaries of the city. Traditionally, feasting and sacrifices were performed during Terminalia at boundary markers, and we will do the same with things like poetry, cake, flowers or a drink! The boundary markers around Leeds are called bars (gates, possibly that barred off an entrance) and mark the borders where the city ended and the countryside began. Most are recorded and some still exist. In addition to the historical boundaries that we encounter, you are invited to discover the hidden and not so hidden boundaries and borders that are concrete, social, political or virtual in the city.

  Meet at 2:00 for a 2:15 departure at the North Bar bar (24 New Briggate) then clockwise to the East Bar by the Parish Church, then onto the South Bar, (Adelphi comfort stop) then to the West Bar, near City Square and onto the Burley Bar (Woodhouse Lane, and should be viewable this year!) and completing the circle back at the North Bar for further festivities.
