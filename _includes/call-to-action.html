                <p>Terminalia is a one day festival of walking, space, place and psychogeography on Friday 23rd Feburary 2018. Terminalia is the festival of Terminus, Roman god of boundaries and landmarks so if there was ever a god and festival for psychogeography this would be it! Events have been run <a class="dark" href="/past">on this day since 2011.</a>

                    Want to run an event for Terminalia 2018? <a class="dark" href="#contact">Contact Tim</a> to add your event here. Events should be, psychogeographical, open to anyone to attend,  and ideally free to attend (but sometimes things cost, and that's ok)<br />
                    You set up the event, handle the numbers etc and it can show up here. <br />
                    Events that are private, solitary, online only or not open to all can be placed in a smaller section of the site.
