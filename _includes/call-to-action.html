                <p>Terminalia is a one day festival of walking, space, place and psychogeography on 23rd Feburary. Terminalia is the festival of Terminus, Roman god of boundaries and landmarks so if there was ever a god and festival for psychogeography this would be it! Events have been run <a class="dark" href="/past">on this day since 2011.</a>

                    Until the Old Normal returns, the Terminalia Festival of Psychogeography will go underground for 2021. No events will be listed here this year. 
                    <br />

                    The festival is open source - anyone is able to run their own event under the Terminalia Festival of Psychogeography, just go ahead and do it. 

                    <!-- Want to run an event for Terminalia 2020? <a class="dark" href="#contact">Contact Tim</a> to add your event here. Events should be, psychogeographical, open to anyone to attend,  and ideally free to attend (but sometimes things cost, and that's ok)<br />
                    You set up the event, handle the numbers etc and it can show up here. <br />
                    Events that are private, solitary, online only or not open to all can be placed in a smaller section of the site.     -->
