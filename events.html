<h3><a name="beating-the-bounds" class="anchor" href="#beating-the-bounds"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Leeds - Beating the Bounds</h3>

<p>
6pm for a 6.30pm departure. Meeting in The North Bar Pub, North Street, then around the city. Free. </p>

<p><span class="event_title">Leeds - Beating the Bounds</span> - Circular walk around medieval boundary of Leeds. Bring treats to share, flowers to leave and drinks to keep you warm! With events, interventions, and special performances from local artists. More details coming soon.
</p>
<p>
We will be walking in an clockwise direction around the city, visiting the ancient boundary stone markers that defined the medieval boundaries of the city. Traditionally, feasting and sacrifices were performed during Terminalia at boundary markers, and we will do the same with things like poetry, cake, flowers or a drink! The boundary markers around Leeds are called bars (gates, possibly that barred off an entrance) and mark the borders where the city ended and the countryside began. Most are recorded and some still exist.
</p>


<h4 class="inline">Simon Bradley: Displacement Activity</h4>
<p>
  A special Displacement Activities intervention involving the group participating in a sonic boundary ritual will occur at some undisclosed part of the walk.
</p>


<h4 class="inline">Performances</h4>
<p>
Anzir Boodoo will perform a traditional Roman blessing at the city's transport termini. The walk may also visit the new glittering southern entrance to the railway station where an invocation to a Roman river god will be enacted as we stand over the water.
</p>

<h4 class="inline">Mapping the intangible.</h4>
<p>
This year our walk will include the opportunity to contribute to a new map of the city which will endeavor to contain some of our thoughts, feelings, memories and insights about the experience of Leeds. <a href="https://twitter.com/lizcable">Liz Cable</a>, Senior Lecturer in Digital Narratives at Leeds Trinity University will collate and curate your responses to the prompts of the city, and your experience of the Festival: photographs, doodles, memories, prose, poetry, sounds, commentary. What memories do we leave behind as as we walk into the new year. What wishes do we have for this city? Our collection will be mapped onto the city using augmented reality and available for download and re-experience as a mobile app.
</p>

<p>
Bring yourselves, sticks, warm clothes and to share: some cake, drinks and flowers!
</p>
